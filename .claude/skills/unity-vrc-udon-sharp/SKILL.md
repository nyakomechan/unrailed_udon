# UdonSharp Skill

## Why This Skill Matters

UdonSharp looks like regular Unity C# scripting — until you hit its hidden walls. Many standard C# features (`List<T>`, `async/await`, `try/catch`, LINQ, generics) **silently fail or refuse to compile** in code that runs in the Udon runtime. Editor-evaluated field initializers are a separate context: they can use some ordinary C# features to generate a final value that Udon can hold. Networking is even more treacherous: modifying a synced variable without ownership produces no error — it just does nothing. Forgetting `RequestSerialization` means your state changes never leave your machine. Standard single-player local testing gives zero signal about these networking bugs because there is only one player.

Every rule in this skill exists because UdonSharp's default behavior is to **fail silently**. Read the Rules before generating any code.

## Before Writing Network Code

Four architectural decisions that must be made before choosing sync modes or writing any synced variable. Changing them mid-implementation typically requires a full rewrite:

- **Who owns this state?** One owner writes; all others read. If two players can both write (e.g., a shared toggle), you need an ownership transfer protocol — writes without ownership are silently discarded.
- **When does ownership transfer?** On grab? Interact? Game event? `OnPlayerLeft`? `Networking.SetOwner` is **locally immediate** on the calling client — `Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)` is `true` synchronously after the call, and writing `[UdonSynced]` fields plus `RequestSerialization()` immediately afterwards is safe under an `IsOwner` guard. Concurrent `SetOwner` calls from multiple clients are resolved by network arrival order — there is no client-side arbitration, so accept that the loser's write is overwritten.
- **What do late joiners see?** State set only by one-time events (`SendCustomNetworkEvent`) is invisible to late joiners. Late-joiner-visible state must live in `[UdonSynced]` variables, which are delivered automatically via `OnDeserialization`; no manual `RequestSerialization()` on join is needed.
- **What if the owner leaves mid-session?** VRChat automatically transfers ownership to a remaining player (selection rule is not publicly documented), and `OnOwnershipTransferred` fires on all clients. Synced variables are preserved, so state is not frozen; decide upfront whether to keep the current value, reset to a known default, or re-apply/re-broadcast derived state in `OnOwnershipTransferred`.

## Context Preservation

For complex synced systems, ownership-sensitive refactors, or work resumed after compaction/handoff, consider loading `references/context-preservation.md`.
It provides a lightweight task-context note for source of truth, transport, sync mode, storage, ownership, late-joiner behavior, and validation rationale.
This is optional guidance for complex work, not a step for small mechanical edits.
Keep private data and raw transcripts out of any note.

For VRChat SDK Build Panel validation alerts, red/yellow/white warnings, or
Auto Fix side effects that involve world scene setup rather than UdonSharp
compiler constraints, use `unity-vrc-world-sdk-3` and read
`references/build-validation.md`.

## Core Principles

1. **Constraints First** — For Udon runtime code, assume standard C# features are blocked until verified. Treat Editor-evaluated field initializers separately and require a final Udon-supported value. Check `udonsharp-constraints.md` before using any API.
2. **Ownership Before Mutation** — Only the owner of an object can modify its synced variables. Always `SetOwner` → modify → `RequestSerialization`.
3. **Late Joiner Correctness** — State must be correct for players who join after events have occurred. Design for re-serialization, not just live updates.
4. **Sync Minimization** — Every synced variable costs bandwidth (see data budget in `udonsharp-sync-selection.md`). Derive what you can locally; sync only the source of truth.
5. **Event-Driven, Not Polling** — Use `OnDeserialization`, `[FieldChangeCallback]`, and `SendCustomEvent` instead of checking state in `Update()` **for state-change reactions; for hot-path or periodic work, see [Event Dispatch & Cross-Behaviour Call Cost Tiers](references/patterns-performance.md#event-dispatch--cross-behaviour-call-cost-tiers)**.

**Synced arrays: always apply them from `OnDeserialization()`**. Array element
changes do not provide a reliable `FieldChangeCallback` signal, and the same
guidance applies to same-length changes, array reassignments, and length
changes. Have the owner call the same idempotent apply method immediately after
mutation, then request Manual serialization once. If a revision guard protects a
historical one-shot side effect, a late joiner's first `OnDeserialization()`
receives the current revision and may otherwise replay that effect. Baseline the
first received revision without the side effect, but run durable `ApplyValues()`
before the baseline check; only later revisions should trigger the one-shot.
Revision is not ordering or stale-packet protection.

## SDK 3.10.4 event receiver arguments

SDK 3.10.5 is the active and verified target for this Skill.
SDK 3.10.4: `UdonSharpBehaviour` implements `IUdonEventReceiver` directly.
An API that requires a receiver can therefore receive `this` directly:

```csharp
VRCStringDownloader.LoadUrl(dataUrl, this);
```

The receiver argument is still required; only the explicit `(IUdonEventReceiver)` cast is unnecessary on the active SDK. Keep any pre-3.10.4 cast in the historical migration reference only. This follows the [official SDK 3.10.4 release notes](https://creators.vrchat.com/releases/release-3-10-4/) and the SDK source declaration.

### Public fields: Inspector visibility is not persistence policy

`[HideInInspector]` only hides a public field from the Inspector; Unity still serializes it. Use `[HideInInspector] public` when Editor-time DI, baking, or autowiring must persist the value into a Scene/Prefab. Use `[System.NonSerialized] public` for a runtime-only value that another UdonBehaviour must access through direct access or `SetProgramVariable`. When `[HideInInspector]` is intentional, leave a comment explaining why the value must be persisted.

### Editor-evaluated field initializers

Field initializers are evaluated as ordinary C# on the Unity/Editor side to produce initial data for the compiled Udon program; their expressions do not run in the Udon runtime. A `Random.Range` call in an initializer is evaluated in the Editor and stored as a baked default, not runtime randomness. LINQ, lambdas, or a same-behaviour static helper that uses `List<T>` can therefore generate an array initializer even though the same code is unavailable from `Start()`, `Interact()`, or another Udon runtime method. The final field type and value must be supported by Udon. Keep generation independent of scene, player, and runtime state, and do not call main-thread-only Unity APIs because field initializers and constructors can run on a loading thread. See `references/constraints.md` for both supported forms and their boundaries.

Use `Start()` or a lazy-init guard only for local or per-client randomness. For shared per-object or per-session seed/state, the owner generates it and stores it in a `[UdonSynced]` field; with Manual sync, establish ownership before writing and then call `RequestSerialization()`. Receivers may apply derived state in `OnDeserialization()` when needed, but that callback is not required for the field synchronization itself, and late joiners receive the current synced state.

## Common Mistakes (NEVER List)

These Udon runtime and Unity serialization constraints cause either **compile-time failures** or **silent data errors**. Check this list before writing UdonSharp code or serialized initial values.

| # | NEVER do this | Why it fails silently | Use instead |
|---|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Use `List<T>`, `Dictionary<T,K>`, or any generic collection in Udon runtime code | Compile error — blocked by Udon compiler | `T[]` arrays, `DataList`, `DataDictionary` (`DataDictionary.EnsureCapacity` / custom capacities require SDK 3.10.4+); Editor-evaluated field generation is the limited exception above |
| 2 | Use `async`/`await`, `System.Threading`, or coroutines | Udon is single-threaded; these features do not exist | `SendCustomEventDelayedSeconds()` |
| 3 | Modify `[UdonSynced]` fields without owning the object | Change appears local but is **silently reverted** on next deserialization | `Networking.SetOwner()` before modify, then `RequestSerialization()` |
| 4 | Forget `RequestSerialization()` after modifying synced fields (Manual sync) | State changes never leave the local client — no error, no warning | Always call `RequestSerialization()` after modifying `[UdonSynced]` fields |
| 5 | Use `try`/`catch`/`finally`/`throw` | Compile error — exception handling is blocked | Defensive null checks + early return |
| 6 | Access `Networking.LocalPlayer` in field initializers | Editor-side initial value generation has no player or Udon runtime state | Initialize in `Start()` or use lazy-init guard |
| 7 | Use `static` fields for per-instance state | Static fields are shared across all instances on the same client and are not synced | Instance fields with `[UdonSynced]` if sync is needed |
| 8 | Call `RequestSerialization()` every frame in Manual sync | Floods the ~11 KB/s network budget, causing congestion for the entire world | Throttle to 1-10 Hz with change detection; check `Networking.IsClogged` |
| 9 | Use LINQ (`.Where`, `.Select`, etc.) or lambda expressions in Udon runtime code | Compile error — not supported by Udon compiler | Manual `for` loops with named methods; Editor-evaluated field generation is the limited exception above |
| 10 | Use `Button.onClick.AddListener()` | Not available in Udon — no runtime delegate support | Configure `SendCustomEvent` via Inspector OnClick |
| 11 | Mix Continuous and Manual sync concerns on one behaviour | Wastes bandwidth (discrete values in Continuous) or loses control (redundant `RequestSerialization` in Continuous) | Separate behaviours: Continuous for position/rotation, Manual for discrete state |
| 12 | Write to `[UdonSynced]` fields without an `IsOwner` guard | Non-owner writes are purely local and silently reverted on the next deserialization from the actual owner | `Networking.SetOwner` first if needed (locally immediate), then write under `IsOwner` and call `RequestSerialization()` |
| 13 | Use `[NetworkCallable]` on an unsupported SDK below 3.8.1 (historical migration only) | Compile error — the attribute and parameterized network-event API are unavailable | Use the active SDK target, 3.10.5; for historical migration notes, use synced variables and react in `OnDeserialization`/`FieldChangeCallback` instead of pairing them with a network event |
| 14 | Use PhysBones/Contacts API (`OnPhysBoneGrabbed`, `OnContactEnter`, etc.) on an unsupported SDK below 3.10.0 (historical migration only) | Compiles but silently ignored at runtime — world-side Dynamics did not exist pre-3.10.0, so callbacks never fire | Use the active SDK target, 3.10.5; for historical migration, verify the project is at least SDK 3.10.0 |
| 15 | Use `PlayerData` persistence API on an unsupported SDK below 3.7.4 (historical migration only) | Compile error — missing symbol; `PlayerData`, `PlayerObject`, and `OnPlayerRestored` were added in 3.7.4 and are not in the Udon whitelist before then | Use the active SDK target, 3.10.5; for historical migration, verify the project is at least SDK 3.7.4 |
| 16 | Put a Unity `.asmdef` around UdonSharpBehaviour without matching U# Assembly Definition | Unity compiles the C# assembly, but UdonSharp reports the script does not belong to a U# assembly | For simple world scripts, avoid asmdef; for package/asmdef workflows, create the corresponding U# Assembly Definition and set Source Assembly to the Unity `.asmdef` (see `references/assembly-definitions.md`) |
| 17 | Create a `.cs` script without a corresponding `.asset` file | Script is not recognized as UdonBehaviour — "The associated script cannot be loaded", no Udon compilation | **Every time** a `.cs` is created: verify `Assets/Editor/UdonSharpProgramAssetAutoGenerator.cs` exists, install from `references/editor-scripting.md` if missing, notify the user (see Rule 8 in `rules/udonsharp-constraints.md`) |
| 18 | Call `Debug.Log()` inside `Update()`, `PostLateUpdate()`, or any per-frame event | VRChat's client-side log rate limiter silently drops excess entries; the implicit string allocation every frame causes sustained GC pressure that tanks framerate. ClientSim and Unity Editor hide both symptoms | Guard with `if (debugMode && Time.frameCount % 60 == 0)`, or move all logging to event-driven callbacks |
| 19 | Use `[UdonSynced]` on a `GameObject`, `Transform`, `UdonBehaviour`, or any component reference | Only primitives, value types (Vector3, Quaternion, Color, etc.), string, VRCUrl, and simple arrays of these are syncable. Component references either fail at compile time or are silently never serialized depending on SDK version | Sync a player ID (`int`) or scene object index (`int`) and resolve the actual reference locally on each client |
| 20 | Initialize any UdonSharp `VRCUrl` field that needs an independent initial value with `VRCUrl.Empty` | `VRCUrl.Empty` is a shared instance, so Inspector data can leak between fields, array elements, or GameObjects that use the same UdonSharp program | Give `[SerializeField]`, `[UdonSynced]`, and ordinary private fields—and each array element—their own `new VRCUrl("")`; reserve `VRCUrl.Empty` for runtime sentinel use |

## Sync Mode Quick Decision

```text
Changing every frame (position, rotation)?    -> Continuous sync
Changing on user action (toggle, score)?      -> Manual sync + RequestSerialization()
No sync needed (local UI, effects)?           -> NoVariableSync
Need reliable one-shot calls with params?     -> [NetworkCallable] (introduced in SDK 3.8.1; active target 3.10.5)
Temporary effect for all players, no state?   -> SendCustomNetworkEvent (no synced vars)
```

> For detailed decision trees, data budget, and minimization principles, see `rules/udonsharp-sync-selection.md`.

SDKs before 3.8.1 do not define the `NetworkCallable` attribute or parameterized network-event API, so code that uses them normally fails to compile.

A `[NetworkCallable]` method must return `void`.

## Sync Debugging Quick Decision

When sync "looks correct locally but doesn't work for others":

```text
Remote players don't see my state change?
  ├── Did I call RequestSerialization() after writing? (Manual sync) → Add it
  ├── Does the local player own the object?                          → Networking.SetOwner() first
  └── Using Continuous sync for button/toggle state?                → Switch to Manual + RequestSerialization()

RequestSerialization() called but still not syncing?
  ├── Is Networking.IsClogged == true?           → Throttle; retry after delay
  └── Non-owner writing the field?               → Acquire ownership first — a non-owner RequestSerialization() is a silent no-op (see NEVER #12)

Late joiners don't see current state?
  ├── State set only on event (e.g., player trigger)?  → Verify the state lives in a [UdonSynced] field — synced values are delivered to late joiners automatically; SendCustomNetworkEvent calls before join are never replayed
  └── Using SendCustomNetworkEvent for persistent state? → Use [UdonSynced] variables instead

OnOwnershipTransferred not firing on a remote client?
  └── On the caller, the callback fires synchronously inside SetOwner — confirm the calling client called Networking.SetOwner(LocalPlayer, gameObject), and that remote clients resolve the same gameObject reference (scene path or prefab GUID)
```

## Pattern Selection Guide

Six pattern files cover different domains. Use this quick routing to pick the right one:

```text
Building a UI, menu, or HUD?           -> patterns-ui.md
VR finger/touch interaction on Canvas? -> patterns-ui.md
Modular app with multiple screens?     -> patterns-ui.md
Syncing state across players?           -> patterns-networking.md
Multiple identical rooms from one model? -> patterns-networking.md (distant-room)
Optimizing Update() or heavy loops?     -> patterns-performance.md
Heavy rebuild, replay, or reset/cancel?  -> patterns-performance.md
Playing or streaming video?             -> patterns-video.md
Need array helpers, event bus, or       -> patterns-utilities.md
  pseudo-delegates?
Basic interactions, timers, audio,      -> patterns-core.md
  pickups, or teleportation?
Station + trigger zone detection?       -> troubleshooting.md
```

> Multiple concerns? Load the primary pattern file plus its dependencies. For example, a synced video player needs both `patterns-video.md` and `patterns-networking.md`.

## Template Selection Guide

17 templates cover common starting points. Pick the closest match and adapt:

| Starting Point | Template | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| **Interaction & Objects** | | |
| Interactive object (click/use) | `BasicInteraction.cs` | Cooldown, toggle, audio feedback |
| Synced toggle / shared object | `SyncedObject.cs` | Ownership guard, FieldChangeCallback, late-joiner init |
| Per-player movement settings | `PlayerSettings.cs` | Walk/run/jump speed via trigger zone |
| Contact-based collision detection | `ContactReceiver.cs` | OnContactEnter/Exit, avatar vs world, debounce (introduced in SDK 3.10.0; active target 3.10.5) |
| **State & Game Logic** | | |
| State machine / game flow | `StateMachine.cs` | Timed transitions, synced state, late-joiner safety |
| Game with undo/history | `UndoableGameManager.cs` | byte[] history, NetworkCallable `_OwnerProcessMove`/`_OwnerUndo`/`_OwnerReset` |
| Object pool (player slots) | `MasterManagedPlayerPool.cs` | FIFO ring buffer, master-managed, OnPlayerJoined/Left |
| **Persistence & Data** | | |
| Save/load player data | `DataPersistence.cs` | PlayerData API, OnPlayerRestored, auto-save (introduced in SDK 3.7.4; active target 3.10.5) |
| **Networking Patterns** | | |
| Rate-limited sync (slider drag) | `RateLimitedSync.cs` | 0.15s cooldown, last-write-wins |
| Batched sync (rapid events) | `BatchedSync.cs` | Idempotent schedule, 0.2s delay, single packet |
| Congestion-aware retry | `CloggedRetrySync.cs` | IsClogged check, linear back-off, MaxRetries |
| Dual local+synced copy | `DualCopySync.cs` | Local working copy + synced transport, dirty flag |
| Pack multiple values into one field | `PackedStateSync.cs` | 3 ints in one Vector3, reduced sync overhead |
| **Utilities** | | |
| Array helpers (List\<T\> alternative) | `ArrayUtils.cs` | Add, Remove, Contains, FindIndex, Shuffle for arrays |
| Event bus (pub/sub) | `EventBus.cs` | Subscriber list (max 32), RegisterListener/RaiseEvent |
| Custom editor inspector | `CustomInspector.cs` | UdonSharpGUI, Undo, proxy sync |
| Auto-generate .asset for new scripts | `UdonSharpProgramAssetAutoGenerator.cs` | AssetPostprocessor, domain-reload-only, auto-compile |

> **Multiple needs?** Start with the template closest to your primary concern, then pull patterns from others. For example, a synced game with undo needs `UndoableGameManager.cs` as the base plus patterns from `RateLimitedSync.cs` for throttling.

## Rules (Constraints & Networking)

Compile constraints and networking rules are defined in **always-loaded Rules**:

| Rule File | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `rules/udonsharp-constraints.md` | Blocked features, code generation rules, attributes, syncable types |
| `rules/udonsharp-networking.md` | Ownership, sync modes, RequestSerialization, NetworkCallable, network-event sender authorization |
| `rules/udonsharp-sync-selection.md` | Sync pattern selection, data budget, minimization principles |

> After installation, place these in the agent's rules directory for automatic loading.

## SDK Versions

**Active support / last verified**: SDK 3.10.5

From v4.0.0 onward, the policy is latest stable SDK only; support moves to a new stable release only after this repository verifies it. A new stable release is not supported automatically. Current last verified target: 3.10.5.

The table below keeps feature-introduction history for migration reference. SDK 3.7.1-3.10.4 entries are historical information only; they are not active support or validation targets for this Skill. This is the Skill's support boundary, not a statement about VRChat's own SDK policy. Primary generated examples target SDK 3.10.5 unless a reference explicitly marks a historical migration case.

| SDK Version | Key Features | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 3.7.1 | Added `StringBuilder`, `RegularExpressions`, `System.Random` | Historical |

| 3.7.6 | Multi-platform Build & Publish (PC + Android simultaneously) | Historical |
| 3.8.0 | PhysBone dependency sorting, Drone API (VRCDroneInteractable) | Historical |
| 3.8.1 | **`[NetworkCallable]`** attribute, parameterized network events, `NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer`/`.InNetworkCall`, `NetworkEventTarget.Others`/`.Self` | Historical |
| 3.9.0 | Camera Dolly API, Auto Hold pickup simplification | Historical |
| 3.10.0 | **VRChat Dynamics for Worlds** (PhysBones, Contacts, VRC Constraints) | Historical |
| 3.10.1 | Bug fixes and stability improvements | Historical |
| 3.10.2 | EventTiming extensions, PhysBones fixes, shader time globals | Historical |
| 3.10.3 | `VRCPlayerApi.isVRCPlus`, VRCRaycast (avatar), Mirror render-order fix | Historical |
| 3.10.4 | VRCTween, Box-shaped Contacts, Global Avatar PhysBone Colliders, world `VRCPhysBoneCollider` Udon access, DataList/DataDictionary custom capacity, `DataDictionary.EnsureCapacity`, `UdonSharpBehaviour` implements `IUdonEventReceiver` and accepts direct receiver `this` | Historical |
| 3.10.5 | WorldQualitySettings, writable VRCQualitySettings, Assembly Version Defines, Pickup Outline Renderers, Pipeline Manager validation | Active / Last verified |

Use SDK 3.10.5 for publishing. Check the matching release notes before relying on a version-specific API or migration step.

## Templates (`assets/templates/`)

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BasicInteraction.cs` | Interactive object with `Interact()` handler |
| `SyncedObject.cs` | Network-synced object (Manual sync, ownership guard, late-joiner init flag) |
| `PlayerSettings.cs` | Per-player movement settings (walk/run/jump speed) |
| `StateMachine.cs` | State machine with synced state and transitions |
| `DataPersistence.cs` | PlayerData save/load with OnPlayerRestored (introduced in SDK 3.7.4; active target 3.10.5) |
| `ContactReceiver.cs` | Contact receiver for world-side collision detection (introduced in SDK 3.10.0; active target 3.10.5) |
| `CustomInspector.cs` | Custom editor inspector with UdonSharpEditor |
| `MasterManagedPlayerPool.cs` | Master-managed player object pool for non-security session arbitration; FIFO ring buffer; OnPlayerJoined/Left; `_VerifyAssignments` after master handoff |
| `EventBus.cs` | Subscriber list event bus (max 32 listeners); RegisterListener/UnregisterListener/RaiseEvent; in-place compaction |
| `ArrayUtils.cs` | List\<T\> alternatives: Add, Contains, AddUnique, Remove, RemoveAt, Insert for GameObject[]; FindIndex/ShuffleArray for int[] |
| `UndoableGameManager.cs` | History/undo sync with byte[] state history; NetworkCallable `_OwnerProcessMove`/`_OwnerUndo`/`_OwnerReset` |
| `PackedStateSync.cs` | Pack 3 ints into one Vector3 UdonSynced field; OnPreSerialization/OnDeserialization |
| `RateLimitedSync.cs` | 0.15s sync cooldown with _syncLocked/_changeCounter; _OnSyncUnlock callback |
| `DualCopySync.cs` | Local + synced copy with _dirty flag; strict OnPreSerialization/OnDeserialization separation |
| `BatchedSync.cs` | Idempotent ScheduleBatchedSync with 0.2s BatchDelay; _FlushBatch delayed callback |
| `CloggedRetrySync.cs` | Networking.IsClogged check; linear back-off (RetryDelay * retryCount); MaxRetries=5 |
| `UdonSharpProgramAssetAutoGenerator.cs` | AssetPostprocessor that auto-creates UdonSharpProgramAsset for new scripts |

## Hooks

| Hook | Platform | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `validate-udonsharp.ps1` | Windows (PowerShell) | PostToolUse constraint validation |
| `validate-udonsharp.sh` | Linux/macOS (Bash) | PostToolUse constraint validation |

The Bash validator requires `jq`. If it is unavailable, the hook passes its
input through unchanged and emits `VALIDATOR-WARNING: validation skipped
(JQ_UNAVAILABLE)` instead of silently reporting successful validation.
