# VRChat API Reference (UdonSharp)

Complete reference of VRChat-specific classes, methods, and types available in UdonSharp.

**Active support / last verified**: SDK 3.10.5

Older version numbers in this reference record feature introductions or migration facts only; SDK 3.7.1-3.10.4 are not supported or validation targets for this Skill.

## VRCPlayerApi

Player information and actions. Obtained from `Networking.LocalPlayer` or event parameters.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|------|
| `displayName` | `string` | Player's display name |
| `playerId` | `int` | Unique player ID within this instance |
| `isLocal` | `bool` | True if this is the local player |
| `isMaster` | `bool` | True if this is the instance master |
| `isInstanceOwner` | `bool` | True if this is the instance owner |
| `isUserInVR` | `bool` | True if using VR |
| `isSuspended` | `bool` | True if suspended (tabbed out) |
| `isGrounded` | `bool` | True if grounded on the floor |
| `isVRCPlus` | `bool` | True if the player has an active VRC+ subscription (requires SDK 3.10.3+) |

#### `isVRCPlus` — Timing and Per-Client Evaluation (SDK 3.10.3+)

`isVRCPlus` is evaluated **per-client, on the local machine**. Each client reads its own value from VRChat account data — the value for a remote player is whatever that player's client has reported to the network.

Two properties of that model drive correct usage:

- **Timing**: Reading `isVRCPlus` inside `OnPlayerJoined` is not guaranteed to return an authoritative value. `OnPlayerJoined` fires during the network handshake before the player's profile and persistence data have settled; the subscription state may still be unset when the event fires. Gate reads behind `OnPlayerRestored` (or a local `_playerReady` flag set there) — `OnPlayerRestored` fires after persistence data has been loaded, which is the earliest point where account-tied properties are reliable.
- **Anti-sync**: Do **NOT** store `isVRCPlus` in an `[UdonSynced]` variable and broadcast it. Each client must read `player.isVRCPlus` on its own against the `VRCPlayerApi` it holds. Syncing a single master-evaluated value will misreport the state for every other player and is a correctness bug, not a bandwidth optimisation. (See NEVER #18 for the general form of this anti-pattern; `isVRCPlus` is a new axis — "per-client evaluation" rather than "component reference.")

For a worked example of reading the property and enabling a local `GameObject` based on it, see `patterns-core.md` (VRC+ Detection — Reading `isVRCPlus`).

### Movement Methods

```csharp
// Teleport player
player.TeleportTo(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation);
player.TeleportTo(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation, VRC_SceneDescriptor.SpawnOrientation orientation);

// Get/Set velocity
Vector3 velocity = player.GetVelocity();
player.SetVelocity(Vector3 velocity);

// Movement settings
player.SetWalkSpeed(float speed);        // Default: 2.0
player.SetRunSpeed(float speed);         // Default: 4.0
player.SetStrafeSpeed(float speed);      // Default: 2.0
player.SetJumpImpulse(float impulse);    // Default: 3.0
player.SetGravityStrength(float strength); // Default: 1.0

// Immobilize player (prevent movement)
player.Immobilize(bool immobile);
```

### Position Methods

```csharp
// Get positions
Vector3 position = player.GetPosition();
Quaternion rotation = player.GetRotation();

// Get bone position (for avatar bones)
Vector3 bonePos = player.GetBonePosition(HumanBodyBones bone);
Quaternion boneRot = player.GetBoneRotation(HumanBodyBones bone);

// Tracking data (VR headset, controllers)
VRCPlayerApi.TrackingData trackingData = player.GetTrackingData(TrackingDataType type);
// trackingData.position, trackingData.rotation
```

### Voice and Audio

```csharp
// Voice settings — how the local (listening) player hears the target player
player.SetVoiceGain(float gain);              // 0-24 dB, default 15
player.SetVoiceDistanceNear(float distance);  // Default: 0
player.SetVoiceDistanceFar(float distance);   // Default: 25
player.SetVoiceVolumetricRadius(float radius); // Default: 0
player.SetVoiceLowpass(bool enabled);         // Default: true

// Getters for the same settings (release-noted in SDK 3.6.1; see Note)
float gain    = player.GetVoiceGain();
float near    = player.GetVoiceDistanceNear();
float far     = player.GetVoiceDistanceFar();
float radius  = player.GetVoiceVolumetricRadius();
bool  lowpass = player.GetVoiceLowpass();
```

> **Note**: The voice getters are named in the [SDK 3.6.1 release notes](https://creators.vrchat.com/releases/release-3-6-1/) — added to `VRCPlayerApi` and exposed to Udon — but do not appear on the current [Player Audio](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/players/player-audio/), Players, or UdonSharp API reference pages. Each is parameterless and returns the value type of its matching setter (4 `float`, 1 `bool`). This entry records that they exist and their signatures; it does not specify runtime read semantics. What a getter returns before its setter has run, whether it reflects the last value set versus the live effective value, and whether local- and remote-player reads behave identically, are not verified here — confirm against your SDK/client before relying on a getter's return value (for example, before using one in place of your own tracked state). The planned voice-audio rework did not ship in SDK version 3.10.4; re-check these getter semantics when an official release includes that rework.

### Avatar Methods

```csharp
// Avatar audio parameters
player.SetAvatarAudioGain(float gain);
player.SetAvatarAudioNearRadius(float radius);
player.SetAvatarAudioFarRadius(float radius);
player.SetAvatarAudioVolumetricRadius(float radius);
player.SetAvatarAudioForceSpatial(bool force);
```

### Avatar Scaling Methods

```csharp
// Get current avatar eye height
float eyeHeight = player.GetAvatarEyeHeightAsMeters();

// Set avatar eye height limits (local player only)
// Minimum: >= 0.2 meters, Maximum: <= 5.0 meters
player.SetAvatarEyeHeightMinimumByMeters(0.5f);
player.SetAvatarEyeHeightMaximumByMeters(3.0f);

// Get current limits
float minHeight = player.GetAvatarEyeHeightMinimumAsMeters();
float maxHeight = player.GetAvatarEyeHeightMaximumAsMeters();

// Set avatar eye height directly (within limits)
player.SetAvatarEyeHeightByMeters(1.6f);

// Set avatar eye height by multiplier (relative to avatar's default)
player.SetAvatarEyeHeightByMultiplier(1.5f); // 1.5x default height
```

### Pickup Methods

```csharp
// Get pickup in hand
VRC_Pickup pickup = player.GetPickupInHand(VRC_Pickup.PickupHand hand);

// Play haptic feedback
player.PlayHapticEventInHand(VRC_Pickup.PickupHand hand, float duration, float amplitude, float frequency);
```

### Player Tags

```csharp
// Tags (local only, not synced)
player.SetPlayerTag(string tagName, string tagValue);
string value = player.GetPlayerTag(string tagName);
player.ClearPlayerTags();
```

### Language Methods

```csharp
string language = VRCPlayerApi.GetCurrentLanguage(); // local user's selected language, RFC 5646: en, ja, zh-CN
string[] languages = VRCPlayerApi.GetAvailableLanguages(); // selectable languages
```

These are local-user getters, not per-remote-player reads.

### PlayerObject Methods

```csharp
// Find a component in the player's PlayerObject instance
// The reference parameter identifies which component type to find
Transform matched = (Transform)player.FindComponentInPlayerObjects(referenceTransform);

// Always validate before use
if (Utilities.IsValid(matched))
{
    Debug.Log($"Found transform: {matched.name}");
}
```

`FindComponentInPlayerObjects` searches the PlayerObject hierarchy belonging to `player` for a component that matches the type and identity of the reference. The return value must be cast to the target component type. Always check with `Utilities.IsValid()` before using the result, as the player's PlayerObject may not be loaded yet.

### Validity Check

```csharp
// Always check before using player reference
if (player != null && player.IsValid())
{
    // Safe to use player
}
```

## Networking Class

Static methods for network operations.

### Core Methods

```csharp
// Get local player
VRCPlayerApi localPlayer = Networking.LocalPlayer;

// Check instance master
bool isMaster = Networking.IsMaster;

// Get server time (synced across all players)
double serverTime = Networking.GetServerTimeInSeconds();

// Check network congestion
bool clogged = Networking.IsClogged;

// Simulate latency (for testing, editor only)
Networking.SimulateNetworkLatency(float latency);
```

### Ownership

```csharp
// Check ownership
bool isOwner = Networking.IsOwner(VRCPlayerApi player, GameObject obj);
bool isOwner = Networking.IsOwner(GameObject obj); // Checks local player

// Get owner
VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(GameObject obj);

// Transfer ownership
Networking.SetOwner(VRCPlayerApi player, GameObject obj);
```

### Player Enumeration

```csharp
// Get player count
int count = VRCPlayerApi.GetPlayerCount();

// Get all players
VRCPlayerApi[] players = new VRCPlayerApi[VRCPlayerApi.GetPlayerCount()];
VRCPlayerApi.GetPlayers(players);

// Get player by ID
VRCPlayerApi player = VRCPlayerApi.GetPlayerById(int playerId);
```

## NetworkCalling Class (SDK 3.8.1+)

Sender context plus monitoring and management of the network event queue.

```csharp
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;

// True throughout the active network-call lifetime, including nested calls.
bool inNetworkCall = NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall;

// The player who initiated the active network call. This is null or invalid
// when execution is not inside a network call.
VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
if (NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall && caller != null && caller.IsValid())
{
    Debug.Log($"Network call from {caller.displayName}");
}

// Get queued events for a specific method on this behaviour
int queuedCount = NetworkCalling.GetQueuedEvents(
    this,
    nameof(_MyNetworkMethod)
);

// Get all outgoing events queued by this local sender
int totalQueued = NetworkCalling.GetAllQueuedEvents();

// Check if network is congested (also available via Networking.IsClogged)
bool isClogged = Networking.IsClogged;
```

### Sender Context Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer` | `VRCPlayerApi` | Player who initiated the active network call; null or invalid outside a network call |
| `NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall` | `bool` | True until the network entry point returns, including execution in nested methods or secondary behaviours |

These properties apply to `[NetworkCallable]` and legacy network events. Do not use a `playerId`, display name, or identity value received as a network parameter for authorization. Read `CallingPlayer`, validate it, then apply the world's explicit authorization policy. `Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)` is still required before the receiver mutates synced state, but that ownership check controls mutation location and does not authorize the caller.

Official behavior reference: [VRChat Network Events](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/events/).

### Usage Example: Rate Limit Monitoring

```csharp
using TMPro;
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

public class NetworkMonitor : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private const float ReceiverCooldown = 1f;

    [SerializeField] private TextMeshProUGUI statusText;
    private float lastAcceptedEventTime = float.MinValue;

    void Update()
    {
        int myEventQueue = NetworkCalling.GetQueuedEvents(
            this,
            nameof(_OnNetworkEvent)
        );
        int totalQueue = NetworkCalling.GetAllQueuedEvents();

        statusText.text = $"My Queue: {myEventQueue}\n" +
                          $"Total Queue: {totalQueue}\n" +
                          $"Clogged: {Networking.IsClogged}";
    }

    public void _SendEvent()
    {
        // Check before sending to avoid queue buildup
        if (NetworkCalling.GetQueuedEvents(this, nameof(_OnNetworkEvent)) < 10)
        {
            SendCustomNetworkEvent(NetworkEventTarget.All, nameof(_OnNetworkEvent));
        }
    }

    [NetworkCallable(1)]
    public void _OnNetworkEvent()
    {
        if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

        VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
        if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

        // Any valid caller may request a diagnostic entry. This receiver-local
        // cooldown bounds aggregate execution across all callers.
        if (Time.time - lastAcceptedEventTime < ReceiverCooldown) return;
        lastAcceptedEventTime = Time.time;
        Debug.Log("Network event received!");
    }
}
```

This diagnostic entry is open to any valid caller. `[NetworkCallable(N)]` paces remote sends for one event on one behaviour and queues excess sends on the sender. It is not an aggregate receiver or resource bound across callers. `GetQueuedEvents` and `GetAllQueuedEvents` observe this client's outgoing queue. The receiver-local cooldown is what caps aggregate log execution on each client.

## VRC_Pickup

Pickup component for holdable objects.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|------|
| `currentPlayer` | `VRCPlayerApi` | Player currently holding (null when not held) |
| `IsHeld` | `bool` | True if currently held |
| `currentHand` | `PickupHand` | Which hand is holding it |
| `pickupable` | `bool` | Whether it can be picked up |
| `DisallowTheft` | `bool` | Prevent theft by other players |

### Methods

```csharp
VRC_Pickup pickup = (VRC_Pickup)GetComponent(typeof(VRC_Pickup));

// Force drop
pickup.Drop();
pickup.Drop(VRCPlayerApi player); // Drop from specific player

// Generate haptic
pickup.GenerateHapticEvent(float duration, float amplitude, float frequency);
```

## VRCStation

Seat/station component.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|------|
| `seated` | `bool` | Whether someone is seated |
| `Occupant` | `VRCPlayerApi` | Current occupant (null when empty) |

### Methods

```csharp
VRCStation station = (VRCStation)GetComponent(typeof(VRCStation));

// Use station
station.UseStation(VRCPlayerApi player);
station.ExitStation(VRCPlayerApi player);
```

## VRCObjectPool

Object pooling for network-aware objects. The pool manages and synchronizes the active state of each held object across all players.

**Class**: `VRC.SDK3.Components.VRCObjectPool`

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Pool` | `GameObject[]` | The objects managed by this pool |

### Methods

| Method | Signature | Owner-only | Network-synchronized |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TryToSpawn()` | `GameObject TryToSpawn()` | Yes | Yes |
| `Return(obj)` | `void Return(GameObject obj)` | Yes | Yes |
| `Shuffle()` | `void Shuffle()` | Yes | Yes |

`TryToSpawn()` and `Return()` are publicly documented on creators.vrchat.com; `Shuffle()` is observed in the SDK 3.10.3 Udon wrapper symbols (`__Shuffle__SystemVoid` in `VRC.Udon.VRCWrapperModules.dll`) but absent from public API docs at the time of writing — its owner-only / synced behavior follows the same runtime contract as the other two methods. All three methods silently no-op when called by a non-owner at runtime; for patterns that require any client to trigger pool operations, see [Usage Pattern: Interact-Driven (User-Triggered)](#usage-pattern-interact-driven-user-triggered).

```csharp
public VRCObjectPool pool;

// Activate an unused object; returns null if all objects are in use.
GameObject spawned = pool.TryToSpawn();

// Return an object to the pool (deactivates it).
pool.Return(spawned);

// Shuffle the internal order of available objects.
pool.Shuffle();
```

### Ownership Behavior

The VRCObjectPool itself is a networked object; only its **owner** can call `TryToSpawn()`, `Return()`, or `Shuffle()`. Non-owner calls silently no-op at runtime (see Methods table above). To support callers from any client (e.g. `Interact()` handlers), see [Usage Pattern: Interact-Driven (User-Triggered)](#usage-pattern-interact-driven-user-triggered).

- **`TryToSpawn()`** activates an available pooled object and returns it. The ownership of the activated object is **not** automatically transferred to any specific player — call `Networking.SetOwner()` explicitly after spawning if you need the spawned object to be owned by a particular player.
- **`Return()`** deactivates the object and returns it to the pool. Only the pool owner can call this method.
- **`Shuffle()`** randomizes the internal order of available pooled objects, synchronized across all clients. Only the pool owner can call this method.

### Network Synchronization

The pool synchronizes the active/inactive state of every held object across all players. Late joiners automatically receive the correct active or inactive state for each pooled object.

### Pooled Object Contract

When writing an UdonSharp behaviour that is intended to run on pooled objects, it should follow this convention so the pool can set ownership correctly:

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDKBase;

public class PooledObject : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    // This callback reports network ownership only. Assignment identity belongs
    // to the manager's synced table and must not be inferred from this callback.
    public override void OnOwnershipTransferred(VRCPlayerApi player)
    {
        if (player != null && player.IsValid())
        {
            Debug.Log($"Network owner changed to: {player.displayName}");
        }
    }

    void OnEnable()
    {
        // OnEnable fires before Start() when the pool activates this object.
        // Use this instead of the deprecated OnSpawn event.
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        // Fired when Return() deactivates this object.
    }
}
```

> **Note**: `OnSpawn` is **deprecated**. Use `OnEnable` to react to an object being activated by the pool.

### Usage Pattern: Master-Managed Pool

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.Components;
using VRC.SDKBase;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class PoolManager : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public VRCObjectPool objectPool;

    // Manager-owned assignment identity. Indexes exactly match objectPool.Pool.
    [UdonSynced] private int[] assignedPlayerIds;

    void Start()
    {
        if (!Utilities.IsValid(objectPool)) return;
        assignedPlayerIds = new int[objectPool.Pool.Length];
    }

    public override void OnPlayerJoined(VRCPlayerApi player)
    {
        if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;
        if (!Utilities.IsValid(objectPool)) return;
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
        if (assignedPlayerIds == null || assignedPlayerIds.Length != objectPool.Pool.Length) return;

        // The manager owner coordinates pool state; this is not caller authorization.
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(objectPool.gameObject))
        {
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, objectPool.gameObject);
        }
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(objectPool.gameObject)) return;

        GameObject spawned = objectPool.TryToSpawn();
        if (spawned == null)
        {
            Debug.LogWarning("No objects available in pool");
            return;
        }

        int poolIndex = _FindPoolIndex(spawned);
        if (poolIndex < 0)
        {
            objectPool.Return(spawned);
            return;
        }

        // Record durable assignment identity before pooled-object ownership changes.
        assignedPlayerIds[poolIndex] = player.playerId;
        RequestSerialization();

        // Network ownership is independent from assignment identity.
        Networking.SetOwner(player, spawned);
    }

    public override void OnPlayerLeft(VRCPlayerApi player)
    {
        if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;
        if (!Utilities.IsValid(objectPool)) return;
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
        if (assignedPlayerIds == null || assignedPlayerIds.Length != objectPool.Pool.Length) return;

        int poolIndex = _FindAssignedPoolIndex(player.playerId);
        if (poolIndex < 0) return;

        if (!Networking.IsOwner(objectPool.gameObject))
        {
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, objectPool.gameObject);
        }
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(objectPool.gameObject)) return;

        GameObject pooledObject = objectPool.Pool[poolIndex];
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(pooledObject))
        {
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, pooledObject);
        }

        assignedPlayerIds[poolIndex] = 0;
        objectPool.Return(pooledObject);
        RequestSerialization();
    }

    public override void OnOwnershipTransferred(VRCPlayerApi newOwner)
    {
        if (newOwner == null || !newOwner.IsValid() || !newOwner.isLocal) return;
        if (!Utilities.IsValid(objectPool)) return;

        // The assignment table is preserved by synced state across handoff.
        // Taking pool ownership does not rewrite any assignment entry.
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(objectPool.gameObject))
        {
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, objectPool.gameObject);
        }
        RequestSerialization();
    }

    private int _FindPoolIndex(GameObject target)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < objectPool.Pool.Length; i++)
        {
            if (objectPool.Pool[i] == target) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    private int _FindAssignedPoolIndex(int playerId)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < assignedPlayerIds.Length; i++)
        {
            if (assignedPlayerIds[i] == playerId) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

The synchronized `assignedPlayerIds` table is the assignment source of truth. Pooled-object ownership may change before `OnPlayerLeft`, so neither `Networking.GetOwner` nor `PooledObject.OnOwnershipTransferred` may be used to identify the assigned player. The manager's synced array survives manager/master handoff; the incoming manager owner only reacquires pool ownership and reserializes the existing table.

### Usage Pattern: Interact-Driven (User-Triggered)

The Master-Managed pattern above protects its pool calls with an `IsOwner` guard inside `OnPlayerJoined`. `OnPlayerJoined` runs on every client when a new player joins; the guard ensures only the pool owner's client actually executes `TryToSpawn()` / `Return()` — non-owner clients early-return safely without hitting a silent no-op at the pool method itself. When the trigger is `Interact()`, the handler body runs only on the interacting player's local client. Writing `pool.TryToSpawn()` directly there works only when the interacting player happens to own the pool — for everyone else the call reaches the pool method and silently no-ops with no exception. There are two correct resolutions, presented as a cost tier below.

| Tier | Approach | Cost | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Forward to current pool owner via `SendCustomNetworkEvent(NetworkEventTarget.Owner, …)`; do spawn inside the owner-side handler | One network event, no ownership change | Default. Preserves whatever ownership scheme the pool already uses (master-managed, last-interactor, etc.). |
| 2 | Take ownership locally with `Networking.SetOwner(LocalPlayer, pool.gameObject)`, then call `TryToSpawn()` / `Shuffle()` directly | One ownership transfer per Interact, no separate event | When the interaction semantically implies "this player now owns the next spawn" (e.g. each player owns their own ammo pool). |

#### Tier 1 — Forward to owner (recommended)

> **Setup precondition**: Attach `PoolInteractForwarded` to the **same GameObject as the `VRCObjectPool`** it references. `NetworkEventTarget.Owner` resolves to the owner of the *sending UdonBehaviour's* GameObject (per [creators.vrchat.com networking events](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/events/)), not to `objectPool.gameObject`. Co-location ensures the event is delivered to the pool owner. If you need the interactor and the pool on separate GameObjects, see Tier 2 instead.

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.Components;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

// Attach this script to the SAME GameObject as the VRCObjectPool it references.
public class PoolInteractForwarded : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public VRCObjectPool objectPool;

    public override void Interact()
    {
        // NetworkEventTarget.Owner targets the owner of THIS UdonBehaviour's
        // GameObject. Since this script is co-located with objectPool, the
        // event is delivered to the pool owner — no ownership change needed.
        SendCustomNetworkEvent(NetworkEventTarget.Owner, nameof(_OwnerSpawn));
    }

    [NetworkCallable(1)]
    public void _OwnerSpawn()
    {
        if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

        VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
        if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

        // Any valid caller may request one available pooled object; this is an open interaction policy.
        if (!Utilities.IsValid(objectPool)) return;
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(objectPool.gameObject)) return;

        objectPool.Shuffle();
        GameObject spawned = objectPool.TryToSpawn();
        if (spawned == null) return;
        // ... assign ownership of `spawned` if needed
    }
}
```

`_OwnerSpawn` runs on the client that owns this script's GameObject, which is also the pool owner under the co-location precondition. The caller check enforces the open interaction policy, and pool capacity limits the number of active objects. The attribute paces each sender's event sends; it does not cap aggregate receiver work. Ownership routing chooses the receiver; it does not authorize the caller.

#### Tier 2 — Take ownership first (acceptable)

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.Components;
using VRC.SDKBase;

public class PoolInteractTakeOwnership : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public VRCObjectPool objectPool;

    public override void Interact()
    {
        Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, objectPool.gameObject);
        objectPool.Shuffle();
        GameObject spawned = objectPool.TryToSpawn();
        // ... assign ownership of `spawned` if needed
    }
}
```

`Networking.SetOwner` is locally immediate post-SDK 2021.2.2, so it is safe to call pool methods on the next line under an `IsOwner` invariant. See [networking.md](networking.md) for the full ownership model.

#### Choosing between Tier 1 and Tier 2

Use Tier 1 by default. Use Tier 2 when the interaction conceptually transfers ownership of the pool to the interacting player — for example, per-player ammo pools or individual draw-card decks. Mixing both patterns in one world is fine when each pool's role is different; Tier framing applies per-pool, not globally.

### VRCObjectPool vs runtime Object.Instantiate

| | VRCObjectPool | runtime Object.Instantiate |
|---|---|---|
| **Sync** | Network-synchronized across all players | Local only — not synced |
| **Ownership** | Managed by pool owner; spawned object ownership must be set manually | No ownership concept |
| **Late joiners** | Receive correct state automatically | Miss any previously instantiated objects |
| **Object reuse** | Pre-allocated pool; `Return()` makes objects available again | Objects persist until destroyed |
| **Use when** | Spawning networked bullets, per-player data containers, shared world objects | Local particle effects, client-side previews, non-networked decorations |

#### Decision Flow

```text
Does every player need to see the spawned object?
├── No  --> runtime Object.Instantiate (local, no sync overhead)
└── Yes --> VRCObjectPool (synchronized, ownership-aware)
         Does the object need to be reused frequently?
         ├── Yes --> VRCObjectPool (pooling avoids repeated allocation)
         └── No  --> VRCObjectPool still preferred over runtime Object.Instantiate for synced objects
```

## VRCObjectSync

Automatic position/rotation sync for physics objects.

### Methods

```csharp
VRCObjectSync sync = (VRCObjectSync)GetComponent(typeof(VRCObjectSync));

// Teleport (respects network sync)
sync.TeleportTo(Transform target);

// Respawn to original position
sync.Respawn();

// Enable/disable gravity and kinematic
sync.SetGravity(bool enabled);
sync.SetKinematic(bool enabled);

// Flag for update
sync.FlagDiscontinuity();
```

## VRCUrl / VRCStringDownloader / VRCImageDownloader

For details on the Web Loading API, see `references/web-loading.md`.

**Key Points:**
- `VRCStringDownloader.LoadUrl(url, this)` -- Text/JSON download
- `new VRCImageDownloader().DownloadImage(url, material, this, textureInfo)` -- Image download
- Rate limit: **Once every 5 seconds** (for String/Image each)
- Max image resolution: **2048 x 2048**
- Trusted URLs: Domain allowlist restrictions apply
- Memory management: `IVRCImageDownload.Dispose()` releases the download wrapper, not the GPU texture — destroy the assigned `Texture2D` (see `image-loading-vram.md`)

```csharp
// String Loading (VRC.SDK3.StringLoading)
VRCStringDownloader.LoadUrl(dataUrl, this);
// -> OnStringLoadSuccess / OnStringLoadError

// Image Loading (VRC.SDK3.Image)
var downloader = new VRCImageDownloader();
downloader.DownloadImage(imageUrl, material, this);
// -> OnImageLoadSuccess / OnImageLoadError
```

## Enumerations

### NetworkEventTarget

```csharp
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

NetworkEventTarget.All    // Send to all players including self
NetworkEventTarget.Owner  // Send to object owner only
NetworkEventTarget.Others // Send to all players except self (SDK 3.8.1+)
NetworkEventTarget.Self   // Send to local player only (SDK 3.8.1+)
```

### TrackingDataType

```csharp
VRCPlayerApi.TrackingDataType.Head
VRCPlayerApi.TrackingDataType.LeftHand
VRCPlayerApi.TrackingDataType.RightHand
VRCPlayerApi.TrackingDataType.Origin
```

### PickupHand

```csharp
VRC_Pickup.PickupHand.None
VRC_Pickup.PickupHand.Left
VRC_Pickup.PickupHand.Right
```

### SpawnOrientation

```csharp
VRC_SceneDescriptor.SpawnOrientation.Default
VRC_SceneDescriptor.SpawnOrientation.AlignPlayerWithSpawnPoint
VRC_SceneDescriptor.SpawnOrientation.AlignRoomWithSpawnPoint
```

## Synced Variable Types and Sizes

Know the sizes of synced types for bandwidth optimization:

| Type | Size (bytes) | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| `bool` | 1 | |
| `byte`, `sbyte` | 1 | |
| `short`, `ushort` | 2 | |
| `int`, `uint` | 4 | |
| `long`, `ulong` | 8 | |
| `float` | 4 | |
| `double` | 8 | |
| `char` | 2 | UTF-16 |
| `string` | variable | 2 bytes per char; no separate per-string limit — bounded by sync mode budget |
| `Vector2` | 8 | 2 floats |
| `Vector3` | 12 | 3 floats |
| `Vector4` | 16 | 4 floats |
| `Quaternion` | 16 | 4 floats |
| `Color` | 16 | 4 floats (RGBA) |
| `Color32` | 4 | 4 bytes (RGBA) |
| `VRCUrl` | variable | String-like |

### Bandwidth Limits

- **Continuous sync**: ~200 bytes per UdonBehaviour
- **Manual sync**: ~280KB (280,496 bytes) per UdonBehaviour
- **Total transmission**: ~11 KB/sec

## SerializationResult

Returned from `OnPostSerialization` for debugging:

```csharp
public override void OnPostSerialization(SerializationResult result)
{
    Debug.Log($"Synced {result.byteCount} bytes, success: {result.success}");
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|------|
| `success` | `bool` | Whether serialization succeeded |
| `byteCount` | `int` | Number of bytes serialized |

## DataList and DataDictionary

Generic-like collections from `VRC.SDK3.Data`:

```csharp
using VRC.SDK3.Data;

// DataList (replaces List<T>)
DataList list = new DataList(); // SDK 3.10.4+: use new DataList(64) when count is known
list.Add("item1");
list.Add(42);
list.Add(3.14f);

string str = list[0].String;
int num = list[1].Int;
float flt = list[2].Float;

int count = list.Count;
list.RemoveAt(0);
list.Clear();

// DataDictionary (replaces Dictionary<string, T>)
DataDictionary dict = new DataDictionary(); // SDK 3.10.4+: use new DataDictionary(64) when count is known
dict.EnsureCapacity(128); // SDK 3.10.4+: grow once before bulk inserts
dict["key1"] = "value1";
dict["key2"] = 100;

string val = dict["key1"].String;
int num = dict["key2"].Int;

bool hasKey = dict.ContainsKey("key1");
dict.Remove("key1");
```

### Capacity and Allocation (SDK 3.10.4+)

Use `DataList(int capacity)`, `DataDictionary(int capacity)`, and `DataDictionary.EnsureCapacity(int)` when the expected item count is known before a bulk load or parse. Match the initial capacity to the expected entries, then grow once with `EnsureCapacity` before larger inserts if needed. Pre-sizing reduces internal growth reallocations; arrays are still preferable for tight per-frame loops and single-type hot data.

### DataToken

A type-safe container used by DataList/DataDictionary:

```csharp
DataToken token = new DataToken("hello");
DataToken token = new DataToken(42);
DataToken token = new DataToken(3.14f);

// Type checking
TokenType type = token.TokenType; // String, Int, Float, etc.

// Value extraction
string s = token.String;
int i = token.Int;
float f = token.Float;
bool b = token.Boolean;
```

## PlayerData API (SDK 3.7.4+)

Key-value storage for player data persisted across sessions.

### Static Methods

```csharp
using VRC.SDK3.Persistence;

// Check if key exists
bool exists = PlayerData.HasKey(player, "highScore");

// Get values (with TryGet pattern)
if (PlayerData.TryGetInt(player, "highScore", out int score))
{
    Debug.Log($"High score: {score}");
}

// Set values (only on local player's own data)
PlayerData.SetInt(Networking.LocalPlayer, "highScore", 1000);
PlayerData.SetString(Networking.LocalPlayer, "username", "Player1");
PlayerData.SetFloat(Networking.LocalPlayer, "volume", 0.8f);
PlayerData.SetBool(Networking.LocalPlayer, "tutorialComplete", true);

// Delete key
PlayerData.DeleteKey(Networking.LocalPlayer, "oldKey");
```

### Supported Types

| Method | Type | Size Limit |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `SetBool` / `TryGetBool` | `bool` | 1 byte |
| `SetInt` / `TryGetInt` | `int` | 4 bytes |
| `SetFloat` / `TryGetFloat` | `float` | 4 bytes |
| `SetDouble` / `TryGetDouble` | `double` | 8 bytes |
| `SetString` / `TryGetString` | `string` | No documented per-string cap — bounded by the 100 KB total |
| `SetBytes` / `TryGetBytes` | `byte[]` | ~100KB total |
| `SetVector3` / `TryGetVector3` | `Vector3` | 12 bytes |
| `SetQuaternion` / `TryGetQuaternion` | `Quaternion` | 16 bytes |
| `SetColor` / `TryGetColor` | `Color` | 16 bytes |

### Storage Limits

| Limit | Value |
|------|------|
| PlayerData per player per world | 100 KB |
| PlayerObject per player per world | 100 KB |

### Usage Pattern

```csharp
public class PersistentScore : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private int highScore = 0;
    private bool dataLoaded = false;

    public override void OnPlayerRestored(VRCPlayerApi player)
    {
        if (!player.isLocal) return;

        // Wait for data to be loaded before accessing
        if (PlayerData.TryGetInt(player, "highScore", out int saved))
        {
            highScore = saved;
        }
        dataLoaded = true;
    }

    public void SaveScore(int score)
    {
        if (!dataLoaded) return; // Not loaded yet

        if (score > highScore)
        {
            highScore = score;
            PlayerData.SetInt(Networking.LocalPlayer, "highScore", score);
        }
    }
}
```

## VRCQualitySettings — writable settings (SDK 3.10.5)

For Udon runtime quality controls, use `VRC.SDK3.Rendering.VRCQualitySettings`.
For scene-wide startup defaults, first inspect the SDK's existing
[WorldQualitySettings component](../../unity-vrc-world-sdk-3/references/components.md#worldqualitysettings-sdk-3105)
before writing another controller that could overwrite the same settings.

The official reference's introductory “read-only” description does not apply to
these two properties: the final 3.10.5 SDK exposes getters **and setters**.

| Property | Type | Authoring boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `RealtimeReflectionProbes` | `bool` | Enables/disables realtime probes on all platforms; enabling is not evidence that a world meets its frame budget. |
| `ShadowmaskMode` | `UnityEngine.ShadowmaskMode` | `DistanceShadowmask` support is PC-only. Do not promise the same lighting result on mobile. |

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.Rendering;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.None)]
public class WorldQualityControl : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public void _ApplyQuality()
    {
        // Explicit authoring choice; avoid competing startup setters.
        VRCQualitySettings.RealtimeReflectionProbes = false;
        VRCQualitySettings.ShadowmaskMode = ShadowmaskMode.Shadowmask;
        bool probesEnabled = VRCQualitySettings.RealtimeReflectionProbes;
        ShadowmaskMode mode = VRCQualitySettings.ShadowmaskMode;
        Debug.Log("Quality settings: " + probesEnabled + ", " + mode);
    }
}
```

Do not infer user-setting precedence, the timing of effective rendering changes,
or identical getter behavior across platforms from successful compilation. Test
the intended visual result in VRChat on each target platform. The existing
`OnVRCQualitySettingsChanged` callback handles user quality changes; do not
assume writing these properties fires that event or synchronizes other players.

Sources: [official quality settings reference](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/vrc-graphics/vrc-quality-settings/),
[SDK 3.10.5 release notes](https://creators.vrchat.com/releases/release-3-10-5/).

## VRCCameraSettings API (SDK 3.8.1+; CullingMask and GetCurrentCamera added in 3.9.0)

Read-only access to VRChat's built-in camera parameters. Provides two static instances and an event callback when settings change.

Namespace: `VRC.SDK3.Rendering`

### Static Camera Instances

| Instance | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VRCCameraSettings.ScreenCamera` | The player's main view (desktop window or VR headset) |
| `VRCCameraSettings.PhotoCamera` | The handheld in-game photo camera |

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `PixelWidth` | `int` | Render target width in pixels |
| `PixelHeight` | `int` | Render target height in pixels |
| `FieldOfView` | `float` | Horizontal field of view in degrees |
| `Active` | `bool` | True if this camera is currently active |

```csharp
using VRC.SDK3.Rendering;

// Read main screen camera properties
VRCCameraSettings screen = VRCCameraSettings.ScreenCamera;
int w = screen.PixelWidth;
int h = screen.PixelHeight;
float fov = screen.FieldOfView;
bool active = screen.Active;

// Read photo camera properties
VRCCameraSettings photo = VRCCameraSettings.PhotoCamera;
bool photoOpen = photo.Active;
```

### Event Callback

`OnVRCCameraSettingsChanged` fires whenever any camera property changes (resolution, FOV, active state). Override it on any `UdonSharpBehaviour`.

```csharp
// Signature
public override void OnVRCCameraSettingsChanged(VRCCameraSettings camera) { }
```

### Usage Example

```csharp
using TMPro;
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.Rendering;
using VRC.SDKBase;

public class CameraMonitor : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private TextMeshProUGUI infoText;

    void Start()
    {
        // Initialize display with current values
        UpdateDisplay(VRCCameraSettings.ScreenCamera);
    }

    public override void OnVRCCameraSettingsChanged(VRCCameraSettings camera)
    {
        // Skip changes from the photo camera
        if (camera != VRCCameraSettings.ScreenCamera) return;

        UpdateDisplay(camera);
    }

    private void UpdateDisplay(VRCCameraSettings camera)
    {
        infoText.text = $"Resolution: {camera.PixelWidth}x{camera.PixelHeight}\n" +
                        $"FOV: {camera.FieldOfView:F1} deg\n" +
                        $"Photo cam: {VRCCameraSettings.PhotoCamera.Active}";
    }
}
```

### Notes

```text
- All properties are read-only from Udon. Camera settings cannot be set via this API.
- OnVRCCameraSettingsChanged fires for both ScreenCamera and PhotoCamera changes;
  filter by comparing the parameter with VRCCameraSettings.ScreenCamera.
- PixelWidth / PixelHeight reflect the actual render resolution, which changes when
  the player resizes the window or toggles the photo camera.
```

## VRChat Dynamics API (SDK 3.10.0+)

PhysBones, Contacts, and VRC Constraints in worlds.

### VRCContactReceiver

Receives contact events from Contact Senders.

```csharp
// Get contact receiver component
VRCContactReceiver receiver = GetComponent<VRCContactReceiver>();

// Configure allowed content usage flags and collision tags
receiver.UpdateContentTypes(DynamicsUsageFlags.Avatar | DynamicsUsageFlags.World);
receiver.UpdateCollisionTags(new string[] { "Hand", "Finger", "Custom" });

// Shape properties
float radius = receiver.radius;          // Sphere/Capsule radius (max 3 m)
float height = receiver.height;          // Capsule height along Y, half-spheres included (max 6 m)
Vector3 size = receiver.size;            // Box dimensions (max 6 m per axis after scale)
ContactBase.ShapeType shapeType = receiver.shapeType; // Sphere, Capsule, or Box
```

Shape and dimension properties are read/write from Udon. `height` is only meaningful for Capsule contacts, and `Vector3 size` is only meaningful for Box contacts. When changing runtime shape fields, batch the changes and call `ApplyConfigurationChanges()` once after the batch.

```csharp
receiver.shapeType = ContactBase.ShapeType.Box;
receiver.size = new Vector3(0.5f, 0.1f, 0.5f);
receiver.position = new Vector3(0f, 1f, 0f);
receiver.ApplyConfigurationChanges();

// Assign a scene VRCContactSender in the Inspector, use info.contactSender
// from a contact callback, or call GetComponent only when the Sender is on this GameObject.
VRCContactSender sender = GetComponent<VRCContactSender>();
float proximity = receiver.CalculateProximity(sender);
```

`CalculateProximity(sender)` returns a `0.0-1.0` value for how close the sender is to the receiver center. For a Box receiver with `Use Face Proximity` enabled, the value is measured toward the receiver's positive-Z face instead.

### VRCContactSender

Sends contact events to receivers.

```csharp
VRCContactSender sender = GetComponent<VRCContactSender>();

// Properties
float radius = sender.radius;             // Sphere/Capsule radius (max 3 m)
float height = sender.height;             // Capsule height along Y, half-spheres included (max 6 m)
Vector3 size = sender.size;               // Box dimensions (max 6 m per axis after scale)
ContactBase.ShapeType shapeType = sender.shapeType; // Sphere, Capsule, or Box
```

Shape and dimension properties are read/write from Udon. `height` is only meaningful for Capsule contacts, and `Vector3 size` is only meaningful for Box contacts. After changing shape fields, call `ApplyConfigurationChanges()` once after batching all edits.

### VRCPhysBone

Physics-based bone system in worlds.

```csharp
VRCPhysBone physBone = GetComponent<VRCPhysBone>();

// Properties (read-only state)
bool grabbed = physBone.IsGrabbed;
bool posed = physBone.IsPosed;
float angle = physBone.Angle;
float squish = physBone.Squish;
float stretch = physBone.Stretch;

// Runtime configuration changes require ApplyConfigurationChanges().
physBone.pull = 0.2f;
physBone.spring = 0.8f;
physBone.ApplyConfigurationChanges();
```

### VRCPhysBoneCollider

World PhysBone colliders can be adjusted from Udon.

```csharp
VRCPhysBoneCollider collider = GetComponent<VRCPhysBoneCollider>();

collider.shapeType = VRC.Dynamics.VRCPhysBoneColliderBase.ShapeType.Capsule;
collider.radius = 0.2f;
collider.height = 1.0f;
collider.position = new Vector3(0f, 0.5f, 0f);
collider.rotation = Quaternion.identity;
collider.ApplyConfigurationChanges();
```

`shapeType`, `radius`, `height`, `position`, and `rotation` are documented as read/write for world `VRCPhysBoneCollider` components. Global Collision is configured on the component: avatar global colliders can affect world PhysBones when Allow Collision rules permit it; avatars may have up to four additional global colliders; worlds have no documented count limit; and Global Collision supports only Sphere and Capsule colliders. Udon access for changing global-collider flags is not documented.

### Contact Event Info Payloads

```csharp
public override void OnContactEnter(ContactEnterInfo info)
{
    ContactSenderProxy sender = info.contactSender;
    ContactReceiverProxy receiver = info.contactReceiver;

    if (!sender.isValid || !receiver.isValid) return;

    Vector3 point = info.contactPoint;
    Vector3 velocity = info.enterVelocity;
    string[] matchingTags = info.matchingTags;

    if (sender.usage == DynamicsUsage.Avatar && sender.player != null && sender.player.IsValid())
    {
        Debug.Log($"Avatar sender: {sender.player.displayName}");
    }
    else if (sender.usage == DynamicsUsage.World)
    {
        Debug.Log("World sender");
    }
}

public override void OnContactExit(ContactExitInfo info)
{
    if (!info.contactSender.isValid || !info.contactReceiver.isValid) return;
    string[] matchingTags = info.matchingTags;
}
```

`ContactEnterInfo` carries `contactSender`, `contactReceiver`, `contactPoint`, `enterVelocity`, and `matchingTags`. `ContactExitInfo` carries `contactSender`, `contactReceiver`, and `matchingTags`. The sender/receiver values are proxy objects; check `isValid`, then use `player` and `usage` to distinguish avatar-owned and world-side contacts.

### PhysBone Event Info Payloads

Use the SDK 3.10.4 UdonSharp event names:

```csharp
public override void OnPhysBoneGrabbed(PhysBoneGrabbedInfo physBoneInfo) { }
public override void OnPhysBoneReleased(PhysBoneReleasedInfo physBoneInfo) { }
public override void OnPhysBonePosed(PhysBonePosedInfo physBoneInfo) { }
public override void OnPhysBoneUnPosed(PhysBoneUnPosedInfo physBoneInfo) { }
```

Attach the UdonBehaviour to the same GameObject as the `VRCPhysBone` component. Use the event payload's player reference for grab/pose source information, and read `VRCPhysBone.IsGrabbed`, `IsPosed`, `Angle`, `Squish`, and `Stretch` for current state.

### Usage Example: Interactive Button with Contacts

```csharp
public class ContactButton : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource clickSound;
    public Animator buttonAnimator;

    private bool isPressed = false;

    public override void OnContactEnter(ContactEnterInfo info)
    {
        if (isPressed) return;
        if (!info.contactSender.isValid || !info.contactReceiver.isValid) return;

        isPressed = true;
        clickSound.Play();
        buttonAnimator.SetTrigger("Press");

        ContactSenderProxy sender = info.contactSender;
        if (sender.usage == DynamicsUsage.Avatar && sender.player != null && sender.player.IsValid())
        {
            Debug.Log($"Button pressed by: {sender.player.displayName}");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log($"Button pressed by: {sender.usage}");
        }
    }

    public override void OnContactExit(ContactExitInfo info)
    {
        isPressed = false;
        buttonAnimator.SetTrigger("Release");
    }
}
```

## VRCDroneApi

The drone that a player controls when in drone mode. Obtain the local player's drone via `Networking.LocalPlayer.GetDrone()`.

### Getting the Drone

```csharp
// Get the drone associated with the local player
VRCDroneApi drone = Networking.LocalPlayer.GetDrone();

// Always validate before use — returns null when the player is not in drone mode
if (Utilities.IsValid(drone))
{
    // Safe to use drone
}
```

### Methods

```csharp
// Teleport the drone to a world-space position and rotation
drone.TeleportTo(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation);

// Set the drone's current velocity (world space, meters per second)
drone.SetVelocity(Vector3 velocity);

// Get the VRCPlayerApi of the player piloting this drone
VRCPlayerApi pilot = drone.GetPlayer();
```

### Usage Example

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDKBase;

public class DroneCheckpoint : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform respawnPoint;

    public override void OnDroneTriggerEnter(VRCDroneApi drone)
    {
        if (!Utilities.IsValid(drone)) return;

        // Teleport the drone back to the respawn point
        drone.TeleportTo(respawnPoint.position, respawnPoint.rotation);
        drone.SetVelocity(Vector3.zero);

        VRCPlayerApi pilot = drone.GetPlayer();
        if (Utilities.IsValid(pilot))
        {
            Debug.Log($"{pilot.displayName}'s drone hit a checkpoint");
        }
    }
}
```

## VRC Camera Dolly API (SDK 3.9.0+)

Defines camera dolly animations applied to the local player's VRChat user camera.
Three components work together in a fixed parent-child hierarchy.

**Available since**: SDK 3.9.0

> **No ClientSim preview**: Camera dolly animations do not render in ClientSim.
> Use **Build and Test** to preview animations at runtime.

### Component Hierarchy

```text
GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Animation)
├── GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Path)
│   ├── GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Point)
│   └── GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Point)
└── GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Path)
    ├── GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Point)
    ├── GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Point)
    └── GameObject (VRC Camera Dolly Point)
```

### VRC Camera Dolly Animation — Inspector Parameters

Configure these in the Unity Inspector on the top-level `VRC Camera Dolly Animation` component:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Is Relative To Player` | Anchor animation to the local player's position instead of world origin |
| `Is Speed Based` | Use speed values per point rather than fixed durations |
| `Is Using Look At Me` | Enable Look-At-Me horizontal/vertical offsets on points |
| `Is Using Greenscreen` | Enable Green Screen HSL controls on points |
| `Is Using Multi Stream` | Enable multi-stream animation mode |
| `Path Type` | Interpolation method for the path (linear, smooth, etc.) |
| `Loop Type` | How the animation loops (none, loop, ping-pong) |
| `Capture Type` | Capture methodology for the animation |
| `Focus Mode` | Camera focus mode for this animation |
| `Anchor Mode` | Camera anchor mode for this animation |
| `Paths` | List of `VRC Camera Dolly Path` children; populate via **Collect Paths & Points** |

### VRC Camera Dolly Path — Inspector Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Points` | List of `VRC Camera Dolly Point` children; populated via **Collect Paths & Points** |

### VRC Camera Dolly Point — Inspector Parameters (Keyframe)

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Zoom` | Keyframe zoom value |
| `Duration` | Duration for this keyframe (time-based mode only) |
| `Speed` | Speed for this keyframe (speed-based mode only) |
| `Focal Distance` | Focal distance (manual focus mode) |
| `Aperture` | Aperture value (manual or semi-auto focus mode) |
| `Hue` | Greenscreen hue (greenscreen mode) |
| `Saturation` | Greenscreen saturation (greenscreen mode) |
| `Lightness` | Greenscreen lightness (greenscreen mode) |
| `Look At Me X Offset` | Horizontal Look-At-Me offset (Look-At-Me mode) |
| `Look At Me Y Offset` | Vertical Look-At-Me offset (Look-At-Me mode) |

### UdonSharp API

The scripting surface for Camera Dolly is intentionally minimal. The primary method is:

```csharp
// Apply the animation to the local player's VRChat user camera
dollyAnimation.Import();
```

`Import()` reads all paths and points collected on the `VRC Camera Dolly Animation` component and applies the resulting animation to the camera of the **local client** only. It has no return value.

### Setup and Usage

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.SDK3.Components;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

public class DollyController : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private const float ReceiverCooldown = 5f;

    // Drag the GameObject that holds VRC Camera Dolly Animation into this field
    [SerializeField] private VRCCameraDollyAnimation dollyAnimation;
    private float lastDollyTime = float.MinValue;

    public void _RequestDollyForAll()
    {
        SendCustomNetworkEvent(NetworkEventTarget.All, nameof(_PlayDolly));
    }

    [NetworkCallable(1)]

> **Important**: Before entering Play mode or building, select the top-level `VRC Camera Dolly Animation` object and click **Collect Paths & Points** to register all child paths and points. Any time you add, remove, or re-order children, repeat this step.

### Limitations

- The API applies the animation to the **local player only**. `_RequestDollyForAll` asks each client to run `_PlayDolly`; the receiver validates the active caller before starting the effect.
- `Import()` is the only scripting entry point on the official page; runtime reads or writes of animation, path, or point parameters from UdonSharp are not documented — treat anything beyond `Import()` as unverified.
- There is no event callback when the animation completes.
- No ClientSim preview; Build and Test is required to see the animation.
