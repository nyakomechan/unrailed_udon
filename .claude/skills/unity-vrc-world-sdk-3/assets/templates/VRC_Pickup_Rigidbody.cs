/// <summary>
/// Template for a UdonSharpBehaviour attached to a GameObject with VRC_Pickup and Rigidbody.
///
/// Requirements:
///   - This GameObject MUST have a Rigidbody component (VRC_Pickup will not work without it).
///   - This GameObject MUST have a Collider component (required for Interact detection).
///   - Add VRC_ObjectSync if you want position/physics to sync automatically across players.
///     Without VRC_ObjectSync, ownership is NOT transferred automatically on pickup — you must
///     call Networking.SetOwner() explicitly (done in OnPickup below). Add [UdonSynced] variables
///     and call RequestSerialization() in OnPickup for custom sync behaviour
///     (BehaviourSyncMode.Manual is already set for this).
///
/// Sync mode note:
///   BehaviourSyncMode.Manual is used so that synced variables (if you add any) are
///   serialised on demand via RequestSerialization. If you add VRC_ObjectSync and have
///   no UdonSynced variables, switch to BehaviourSyncMode.NoVariableSync (None would also disable SendCustomNetworkEvent, breaking the use-effect broadcast below).
///
/// Ownership note:
///   VRC_ObjectSync automatically transfers ownership to the grabbing player on pickup.
///   Without VRC_ObjectSync, ownership is NOT transferred automatically — Networking.SetOwner
///   is called in OnPickup to handle this case explicitly.
///
/// Usage:
///   1. Add this script, VRC_Pickup, Rigidbody, Collider, and (optionally) VRC_ObjectSync
///      to the same GameObject.
///   2. Assign optional audio sources in the Inspector.
///   3. Override OnPickupUseDown / OnPickupUseUp to implement custom use behaviour.
