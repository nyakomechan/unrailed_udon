## Build & Upload Issues

### "Missing VRC_SceneDescriptor"

**Symptom**: Error saying SceneDescriptor is missing during build

**Solution**:

```text

1. VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel
2. Builder tab
3. "Add VRChat World" or add VRCWorld Prefab
4. Confirm exactly 1 exists in the scene

```

### "Layer collision matrix needs setup"

**Symptom**: Warning that layer settings are incorrect

**Solution**:

```text

1. VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel
2. Builder tab
3. Click "Setup Layers for VRChat"
4. Layers and collision matrix are automatically configured

```

Before using the setup buttons in a mature project, check
[build-validation.md](build-validation.md#layer-and-collision-setup): layer
setup can move custom layers and requires layer-mask review.

### World not found after upload

**Symptom**: Upload succeeded but world doesn't appear

**Solution**:

```text

1. Log in to the VRChat website
2. Check "My Worlds"
3. Check privacy settings
4. Wait a few minutes (may take time to propagate)
5. Restart the VRChat client

```

### "Build was cancelled"

**Symptom**: Build was cancelled

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check Unity Console for errors
2. Resolve script compilation errors
3. Fix Missing References
4. Build again

```

If the cancellation came from SDK Validations, copy the exact red/yellow/white
message and match it in
[build-validation.md](build-validation.md#sdk-3104-world-alert-catalog).

### "Unsupported component" warnings

**Symptom**: SDK validation flags non-whitelisted scripts or components

**Solution**: Remove them, tag dev-only objects `EditorOnly`, or mark setup-helper
components with `IEditorOnly` — see
[components.md](components.md#editor-only-objects-and-components).
For broader Build Panel alert handling, use
[build-validation.md](build-validation.md).

## Scene Setup Issues

### Player doesn't appear at spawn point

**Symptom**: Appears at an unexpected location when joining

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check the VRC_SceneDescriptor Spawns array
2. Confirm valid Transforms are set in Spawns
3. Verify spawn positions aren't inside obstacles
4. Confirm spawn Y coordinates are above Respawn Height

```

### Player continuously respawns

**Symptom**: Keeps respawning immediately after joining

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check Respawn Height
2. Confirm spawn positions are above Respawn Height
3. Verify spawn positions aren't below the floor
4. Set Respawn Height low enough (e.g., -100)

```

### Reference Camera not taking effect

**Symptom**: Camera settings aren't being applied

**Solution**:

```text

1. Confirm the Reference Camera's Camera component is disabled
2. Verify it's correctly assigned to SceneDescriptor's Reference Camera field
3. For Post Processing, also check the Volume

```

## Component Issues

### Can't grab VRC_Pickup

**Symptom**: Can't interact with or grab the object

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check that a Collider exists
2. Check that a Rigidbody exists
3. Confirm VRC_Pickup's Pickupable is true
4. Verify the layer is correct (Pickup layer recommended)
5. Confirm the Collider is enabled

```

### VRC_Pickup doesn't sync

**Symptom**: Grabbed object not visible to other players

**Solution**:

```text

1. Add VRC_ObjectSync component
2. Confirm a Rigidbody exists
3. Check Is Kinematic settings

```

### Pickup grabbed but immediately released by second player

**Symptom**: A second player grabs the Pickup but it snaps back or releases immediately

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check Allow Theft on VRC_Pickup
2. If Allow Theft is disabled, the current holder owns it exclusively — a second grab is blocked
3. Enable Allow Theft if shared grabbing is intended

```

### Can't release VRC_Pickup

**Symptom**: Can't release a grabbed object

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check Auto Hold settings (SDK 3.9+)
2. Check if an Udon script is preventing Drop
3. Re-add the VRC_Pickup component

```

### Can't sit in VRC_Station

**Symptom**: Can't interact with the Station

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check that a Collider exists on the same or a child GameObject
2. Confirm VRC_Station's Disable Station Exit is false
3. If using UseAttachedStation() in Udon,
   verify the script is on the same object as the Station

```

### Player clips into Station geometry after sitting

**Symptom**: Avatar visually penetrates the seat or floor after sitting

**Solution**:

```text

1. Adjust the Station Enter Player Location transform on the VRC_Station
2. Move Station Enter Player Location to an unobstructed seated position
3. Ensure Station Exit Player Location is also clear of obstacles

```

### Can't exit VRC_Station

**Symptom**: Can't exit after sitting

**Solution**:

```text

1. If Disable Station Exit is true, set it to false
2. Verify Station Exit Player Location isn't inside an obstacle
3. Implement forced exit in Udon

```

### VRC_Mirror doesn't reflect

**Symptom**: Nothing displays in the mirror

**Solution**:

```text

1. Open VRC_MirrorReflection > Layers. Must include:
   - Player (9)
   - PlayerLocal (10)
   - MirrorReflection (18)
   - Environment (11)
2. Confirm the mirror GameObject is enabled
3. Check the camera's Near/Far Clip
4. Check mirror resolution

```

### VRC_ObjectSync is misaligned

**Symptom**: Synced object position differs between players

**Solution**:

```text

1. Call FlagDiscontinuity() on teleport
2. Check Allow Collision Ownership Transfer settings
3. Avoid frequent ownership transfers

```

---

## Layer & Collision Issues

### Player walks through walls

**Symptom**: Passes through walls or objects

**Solution**:

```text

1. Set walls to Environment layer
2. Confirm a Collider exists
3. Check Collider's Is Trigger is false
4. Verify Player and Environment collide in Collision Matrix

```

### Pickup falls through floor

**Symptom**: Dropped objects fall through the floor

**Solution**:

```text

1. Set Pickup to Pickup layer
2. Set floor to Environment layer
3. Verify Pickup and Environment collide in Collision Matrix
4. Set Rigidbody's Collision Detection to Continuous

```

### Object not visible in mirror

**Symptom**: Specific objects don't appear in the mirror

**Solution**:

```text

1. Check the object's layer
2. Verify relationship with MirrorReflection layer
3. Confirm the object's Renderer is enabled

```

---

## Performance Issues

### Low FPS

**Symptom**: Low frame rate

**Solution**:

```text

1. Set mirror to default OFF
2. Reduce/remove realtime lights
3. Bake lights
4. Check video player count (1-2 recommended)
5. Reduce Draw Calls
6. Reduce polygon count
7. Lower texture resolution

```

### Mirror is slow

**Symptom**: FPS drops drastically when mirror is enabled

**Solution**:

```text

1. Lower mirror resolution
2. Limit to 1 mirror
3. Default OFF with toggle
4. Implement auto-disable by distance

```

### Lighting is slow

**Symptom**: FPS drops near lights

**Solution**:

```text

1. Remove realtime lights
2. Change to Mixed or Baked
3. Bake lightmaps
4. Place Light Probes
5. Lower shadow quality

```

---

## Networking Issues

### Object ownership won't transfer

**Symptom**: SetOwner doesn't work

**Solution**:

```csharp

// Correct call:
Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);

// If VRC_ObjectSync is present:
// Check Allow Collision Ownership Transfer settings

```

### Pickup returns to original position on drop

**Symptom**: Dropped object snaps back to its original position for remote players

**Solution**:

```csharp

// Ownership is not being transferred. Call SetOwner before moving:
Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);

// Without ownership transfer, only the local client moves the object
// and it snaps back when the local client releases it.

```

### State doesn't sync for Late Joiners

**Symptom**: State not reflected for players who join later

**Solution**:

```csharp

// Apply state in OnDeserialization
public override void OnDeserialization()
{
    ApplyState();
}

// VRC_ObjectSync auto-syncs
// For Udon variables, use [UdonSynced] attribute

```

## Quest/Android Issues

### World doesn't display on Quest

**Symptom**: Works on PC but not on Quest

**Solution**:

```text

1. Verify with Android build target
2. Check Android shader compile/runtime errors; substitute a mobile-compatible shader or profile and fix the custom world shader
3. Remove Dynamic Bones (disabled on Quest)
4. Remove Cloth (disabled on Quest)
5. Remove Post Processing (disabled on Quest)
6. Compare total geometry with the approximately 250,000-triangle world recommendation, then reduce it if profiling requires

```

### Poor performance on Quest

**Symptom**: Low FPS on Quest

**Solution**:

```text

1. Profile CPU, GPU, render thread, and memory on the target Android device
2. Compare total geometry with the approximately 250,000-triangle world recommendation
3. Minimize materials and draw calls; there is no fixed world material upload limit
4. Keep textures at 1024x1024 or less as a rule of thumb, then verify memory
5. Bake environment lighting; retain realtime lighting only with target-device evidence
6. Prefer Mobile/VRChat/Lightmapped when it fits; profile every custom world shader
7. Minimize transparency
8. Remove or minimize mirrors

```

## Investigation Steps

### Steps for Investigating Unknown Errors

#### Step 1: Check Unity Console

```text

Window > General > Console
- Prioritize errors (red)
- Also check warnings (yellow)
- Identify the source from the stack trace

```

#### Step 2: VRChat SDK Validation

```text

VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel
Builder tab > Validations section
- Auto-fixable issues have buttons for fixing
- Follow instructions for manual fixes
- For exact SDK 3.10.5 red/yellow/white alert meanings and Auto Fix side effects,
  use references/build-validation.md

```

#### Step 3: Build and Test

```text

VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel
Builder tab > "Build & Test New Build"
- Multi-player test with Number of Clients
- Check debug information inside VRChat

```

#### Step 4: Search Official Documentation (WebSearch)

```yaml

WebSearch: "error message or keyword site:creators.vrchat.com"

```

#### Step 5: VRChat Forums Search (WebSearch)

```yaml

WebSearch:
  query: "error message site:ask.vrchat.com"
  allowed_domains: ["ask.vrchat.com"]

```

#### Step 6: Canny (Known Bugs) Search

```yaml

WebSearch:
  query: "issue site:feedback.vrchat.com"
  allowed_domains: ["feedback.vrchat.com"]

```

#### Step 7: GitHub Issues Search

```yaml

WebSearch:
  query: "issue site:github.com/vrchat-community"
  allowed_domains: ["github.com"]

```

## Editor / Runtime Discrepancy

### World works in Unity Editor but fails in VRChat

**Symptom**: Behavior in Editor Play mode differs from actual VRChat client

**Solution**:

```text

Unity Play mode does not replicate all SDK behaviors.
Use "Build & Test New Build" (VRChat SDK > Builder tab) to launch the actual
VRChat client locally. Editor Play is useful only for quick UdonSharp iteration.

```

### Interactive UI element is visible but cannot be clicked in VRChat

**Symptom**: Canvas UI renders but is not interactive in VRChat

**Solution**:

```text

VRC_UIShape requires World Space Canvas.
Screen Space and Overlay modes throw a runtime Unity error in VRChat —
the UI renders visually but is not interactive, with no visible error.

Fix: Set Canvas > Render Mode to World Space before adding VRC_UIShape.

```
