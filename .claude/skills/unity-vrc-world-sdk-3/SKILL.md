## Method Migration

The following public methods were renamed because an unprefixed, parameterless
public UdonSharp method remains callable through legacy network dispatch:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `ForceDropPickup` | `_ForceDropPickup` |
| `IsHeld` | `_IsHeld` |
| `IsOccupied` | `_IsOccupied` |
| `StopSound` | `_StopSound` |
| `SlowUpdate` | `_SlowUpdate` |

Update Inspector event strings, `SendCustomEvent*` calls, delayed events and
`nameof(...)` expressions, and cross-behaviour calls. Compatibility aliases are
not provided because an old unprefixed alias would restore the same legacy network exposure.

## Common Mistakes (NEVER List)

These cause silent world failures, performance disasters, or Quest incompatibility:

| # | NEVER do this | Why it hurts | Use instead |
|---|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Enable Mirror by default (active on world join) | A mirror adds another costly scene render; the impact depends on view, scene, resolution, and device | Default Mirror OFF; add a player-controlled toggle and profile each target device |
| 2 | Use realtime directional lights with real-time shadows without profiling | Realtime shadow cost varies with scene geometry, view, and target device and can dominate frame time on Android | Prefer baked lightmaps + light probes; profile the target device before keeping any realtime shadows |
| 3 | Set Respawn Height at or above the world floor | Player respawns → falls → respawns again → infinite loop; players cannot recover | Set to an unreachable depth (e.g., floor at Y=0 → Respawn at Y=-100) |
| 4 | Skip "Setup Layers for VRChat" on a new project | Layer collision matrix is wrong by default — players walk through walls, Pickups clip floors | Run VRChat SDK > Builder > "Setup Layers for VRChat" before placing any colliders |
| 5 | Enable Post-Processing without an Android build profile | Post-processing is disabled at runtime on Android, so the authored effect will not appear and unnecessary resources can still enlarge the build | Use a separate Android build profile with post-processing removed |
| 6 | Place more than 2 active video players simultaneously | Each player adds significant decoding overhead; running >2 simultaneously is a common cause of frame drops and audio issues in practice | Disable extra players at scene start; activate only the currently playing one |
| 7 | Use Cloth on Android, or add many Unity Constraints without profiling | Cloth is disabled on Android. Unity Constraints are permitted in worlds, but overuse can significantly affect performance | Remove Cloth from the Android build; prefer VRC Constraints for new work and profile any constraint-heavy setup |
| 8 | Upload without completing a lightmap bake | Realtime GI adds substantial scene-dependent render cost and is unsuitable as an unmeasured fallback on Android | Bake lights before upload, then verify the result on the target device |
| 9 | Place player walkable surfaces on Default layer (0) | Collision matrix is wrong by default — avatar physics collision is unreliable; players may clip through geometry | Use Environment (layer 11) for all walkable geometry, walls, and floors |
| 10 | Use very high lightmap resolution for large areas without profiling | Texture memory can spike significantly at high resolutions; a common cause of OOM crashes on mobile headsets | Start at 10-20 texels/unit (PC) / 5-10 (Quest) as a practical guideline; profile VRAM and adjust — official guidance says "keep lightmap resolution low" for Quest |
| 11 | Add VRC_UIShape to a Screen Space or Overlay Canvas | VRC_UIShape requires World Space Canvas; other modes throw a runtime Unity error in VRChat — the UI renders visually but is not interactive, with no visible error to the world builder | Set Canvas > Render Mode to World Space before adding VRC_UIShape |

## Reference Loading Guide

Load only what the task requires.

| Task | MANDATORY READ | Optional | Do NOT Load | Load Rationale |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Setting up a new scene from scratch | `components.md`, `layers.md` | `upload.md` | `audio-video.md`, `troubleshooting.md` | Collision matrix non-obvious; component deps needed upfront |
| Making objects grabbable (VRC_Pickup) | `components.md` | `layers.md` | `audio-video.md`, `lighting.md` | Pickup/Rigidbody requirements not in standard Unity docs |
| Configuring Dynamics for Worlds (PhysBones, Contacts, Box Contacts, Global Avatar PhysBone Colliders, world `VRCPhysBoneCollider` access) | `components.md` | `layers.md`, `troubleshooting.md`; use `unity-vrc-udon-sharp` for Udon code | `audio-video.md`, `lighting.md` | Dynamics component availability and Udon access are SDK-version sensitive |
| Setting up seating (VRC_Station) | `components.md` | `layers.md` | `audio-video.md`, `performance.md` | Station collider + exit requirements are VRChat-specific |
| Optimizing FPS for Quest | `performance.md`, `lighting.md` | `troubleshooting.md` | `audio-video.md`, `upload.md` | Quest limits differ from PC; bake requirements non-obvious |
| Adding audio or video player / voice zones (SetVoiceGain, Steam Audio) | `audio-video.md`, `components.md` | `troubleshooting.md` | `lighting.md`, `performance.md` | AVPro vs Unity Video selection is VRChat-specific |
| Configuring WorldQualitySettings, realtime probes, or Shadowmask Mode | `components.md` | `lighting.md`; Udon API: `unity-vrc-udon-sharp` | `audio-video.md`, `layers.md` | Existing startup setters and override flags can overwrite authored quality choices |
| Baking lights / lightmap setup | `lighting.md`, `performance.md` | — | `audio-video.md`, `layers.md` | Lightmap resolution and probe placement affect Quest VRAM |
| SDK Build Panel validation alerts, red/yellow/white warnings, or Auto Fix questions | `build-validation.md` | `upload.md`, `troubleshooting.md` | `audio-video.md`, `lighting.md` | Alert severity, build consequence, and Auto Fix side effects must come from SDK-backed catalog |
| World upload and publish | `upload.md` | `build-validation.md`, `troubleshooting.md` | `audio-video.md`, `lighting.md` | Upload steps and validation order are fragile; easy to miss |
| Debugging collision or layer issues | `layers.md`, `troubleshooting.md` | `components.md` | `audio-video.md`, `lighting.md` | VRChat collision matrix differs from Unity default |
| Mirror setup and configuration | `components.md` | `performance.md` | `audio-video.md`, `upload.md` | Mirror layer mask requirements are VRChat-specific |

## Before Starting a New World — Design Decisions

These decisions shape every downstream choice. Make them first, before placing any component.

| Decision | Options | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **Quest required?** | Yes / No | Yes → Quest First philosophy applies from day 0, not as a retrofit |
| **Expected player count?** | 1–8 / 9–40 / 40+ | Affects spawn count, mirror policy, max video players |
| **Primary interaction?** | Grab (Pickup) / Sit (Station) / Watch (Video) / Explore | Determines which SDK components are mandatory |
| **Lighting approach?** | Baked / Mixed / Realtime | Prefer baked lighting on Android; profile each target device before keeping realtime lighting or shadows |
| **Networked objects?** | None / Physics (Pickup+ObjectSync) / State (UdonSynced) | Determines sync architecture before Udon scripting begins |

---

## Design Philosophy: Quest First

**If the world must run on Android, decide those constraints before tuning the PC build. Test each target separately.**

Android headsets have mobile CPU, GPU, memory, and thermal budgets that differ
from PC and vary by device:
- **GPU**: Realtime lights, shadows, overdraw, and complex shaders can dominate frame time
- **Memory**: Textures and lightmaps share limited system memory with the client
- **Thermals**: Sustained load can reduce available performance during a session

Measure each target device independently; PC results do not establish Android
performance, and a single-client Quest result does not predict a particular PC
frame rate. Use the Unity Profiler and the [official Android content optimization
guide](https://creators.vrchat.com/platforms/android/quest-content-optimization/)
before publishing.

**NEVER optimize exclusively for PC with "Quest support added later"** — by that point, lighting, materials, and mesh density are all locked to PC quality, and the Quest port requires rebuilding everything.

**Quest First Cascade** — when Quest is required, every downstream decision inherits constraints:

```text
Quest required? → Yes
  ├── Shaders: World shaders are unrestricted; prefer mobile-compatible shaders and profile custom ones
  ├── Lighting: Baked by default; retain realtime effects only after target-device profiling
  ├── Geometry: Budget approximately 250,000 triangles for the whole world; reduce further when profiling calls for it
  ├── Materials: Minimize unique materials and draw calls; no fixed world upload limit is documented
  ├── Audio: Mono, compressed, limited concurrent sources
  └── Physics: Simplified colliders, minimal Rigidbodies
```

## SDK Versions

**Active support / last verified**: SDK 3.10.5

From v4.0.0 onward, the policy is latest stable SDK only; support moves to a new stable release only after this repository verifies it. A new stable release is not supported automatically. Current last verified target: 3.10.5.

The table below keeps feature-introduction history for migration reference. SDK 3.7.1-3.10.4 entries are historical information only; they are not active support or validation targets for this Skill. This is the Skill's support boundary, not a statement about VRChat's own SDK policy. Primary generated examples target SDK 3.10.5 unless a reference explicitly marks a historical migration case.

| SDK    | New Features                                                                   | Status         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| 3.7.1  | StringBuilder, Regex, System.Random                                            | Historical     |
| 3.7.4  | **Persistence API** (PlayerData/PlayerObject)                                  | Historical     |
| 3.7.6  | **Multi-platform Build & Publish** (simultaneous PC + Android builds)          | Historical     |
| 3.8.0  | PhysBone dependency sorting, **Force Kinematic On Remote**, Drone API          | Historical     |
| 3.8.1  | **[NetworkCallable]** events with parameters, `Others`/`Self` targets, VRCCameraSettings | Historical |

## Scene Setup

### VRC_SceneDescriptor (Required)

Exactly **one** is required in every VRChat world.

```text
[VRCWorld Prefab]
├── VRC_SceneDescriptor (Required)
├── VRC_PipelineManager (Auto-added)
├── VRCWorldSettings (Optional - movement speed settings)
└── AvatarScalingSettings (Optional - avatar scale limits)
```

#### Key Properties

| Property                        | Type        | Description                     | Default           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Spawns**                      | Transform[] | Array of spawn points           | Descriptor position |
| **Spawn Order**                 | enum        | First/Sequential/Random/Demo (First: always the first spawn; Demo: spawn point is the center of room scale) | Sequential |
| **Spawn Orientation**           | enum        | Default/Align Player With Spawn Point/Align Room With Spawn Point | Default |
| **Respawn Height**              | float       | Respawn height (Y axis)         | -100               |
| **Object Behaviour At Respawn** | enum        | Respawn/Destroy                 | Respawn            |
| **Reference Camera**            | Camera      | Player camera settings reference | None              |
| **Forbid User Portals**         | bool        | Disable user portals            | false              |
| **Voice Falloff Range**         | float       | Voice attenuation range         | -                  |
| **Interact Passthrough**        | LayerMask   | Interact passthrough layers     | Nothing            |
| **Maximum Capacity**            | int         | Max player count (hard limit)   | -                  |
| **Recommended Capacity**        | int         | Recommended player count (UI)   | -                  |

#### Reference Camera Usage

```csharp
// Usage:
// 1. Adjust Near/Far clipping (recommended for VR: 0.01 ~ 1000)
// 2. Apply Post Processing effects
// 3. Set background color

// ⚠️ MUST disable the Camera component after configuring — an active Reference Camera
//    renders a second viewport. VRChat reads only the camera settings, not its output.
// Assign the configured (disabled) Camera to VRC_SceneDescriptor > Reference Camera.
```

### Spawn Points Setup

```csharp
// Spawn points are empty GameObjects assigned to VRC_SceneDescriptor > Spawns array.
// Players enter facing the Z+ direction of the spawn Transform.

// VRChat-specific requirements:
// - At least 2-3 spawn points (for simultaneous joins — single spawn causes overlap)
// - Place slightly above the floor (~0.1m) to avoid floor collision on spawn
// - Keep clear of obstacles (VR player guardian area is larger than their avatar)
// - Account for VR guardian boundaries — desktop player sizes differ from VR
```

### Required Setup Checklist

```text
□ Exactly one VRCWorld Prefab exists in the scene
□ At least one Transform set in Spawns
□ Respawn Height set to an appropriate value (well below the floor)
□ Reference Camera configured for clipping distances (for VR)
□ Layer/Collision Matrix correctly configured
□ "Setup Layers for VRChat" has been executed
```

## Components

**MANDATORY READ** [`references/components.md`](references/components.md) (~800 lines) before configuring any VRC component below. Load in full — dependency requirements and Udon event hooks are distributed throughout.
**Do NOT Load**: `references/audio-video.md` (unless the task involves audio/video components), `references/lighting.md`.

| Component                  | Required Elements        | Purpose                        | SDK  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---- |

| **VRC_PortalMarker**       | -                        | Portal to other worlds         | -    |
| **VRC_SpatialAudioSource** | AudioSource              | 3D audio                       | -    |
| **VRC_UIShape**            | Canvas (World Space)     | Unity UI interaction           | -    |
| **VRC_AvatarPedestal**     | -                        | Avatar display/switch          | -    |

| **VRCCameraSettings**      | None (static API)        | Read camera info from Udon     | 3.8.1+ |

### VRC_ObjectSync vs UdonSynced

| Scenario                        | VRC_ObjectSync | UdonSynced variables |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Throwable objects / physics     | ✅ Recommended | ❌                   |
| State only / complex logic      | ❌             | ✅ Recommended       |

> **SDK 3.8.0+**: `Force Kinematic On Remote` — Makes Rigidbody kinematic on non-owner clients, preventing unexpected physics behavior.

## Layers & Collision

### VRChat Reserved Layers

| Layer #   | Name                | Purpose                        |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0         | Default             | General objects                |
| 9         | Player              | Remote players                 |
| 10        | PlayerLocal         | Local player                   |
| 11        | Environment         | Environment (walls, floors)    |
| 13        | Pickup              | Grabbable objects              |
| 14        | PickupNoEnvironment | Pickups that don't collide with environment |
| 17        | Walkthrough         | Walk-through objects           |
| 18        | MirrorReflection    | Mirror reflection only         |
| **22-31** | **User Layers**     | **Available for custom use**   |

### Layer Setup Steps

```text
1. VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel
2. Builder tab
3. Click "Setup Layers for VRChat"
4. Collision Matrix is automatically configured
```

**MANDATORY READ** [`references/layers.md`](references/layers.md) when setting up collision or debugging physics. The default Unity collision matrix differs from the VRChat-correct one — always verify.
**Do NOT Load**: `references/audio-video.md`, `references/upload.md`.

---

## Performance

### Performance Criteria

Define the performance target from the supported devices, representative scenes, and expected player count. Record a frame-time or frame-rate target for each build target before profiling. VRChat does not provide one fixed FPS upload threshold for worlds.

### Starting Budgets

| Item                | Recommended           | Reason                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mirrors             | 1, default OFF        | Renders the entire scene 2x   |
| Video players       | 1-2 recommended       | Decoding overhead; no documented hard limit |
| Realtime lighting   | Baked by default      | Keep realtime lights or shadows only after target-device profiling |
| Lightmaps           | Bake and verify       | Primary Android lighting path  |

### Quest/Android Restrictions

| Component          | PC  | Quest         |
| ------------------ | --- | ------------- |
| Dynamic Bones      | ✅  | ❌ Disabled   |
| Cloth              | ✅  | ❌ Disabled   |
| Post-Processing    | ✅  | ❌ Disabled   |
| Unity Constraints  | ✅  | ✅ Permitted in worlds; profile cost |
| Realtime lights    | ✅  | ⚠️ Expensive; keep only with device evidence |

### Performance Optimization Workflow

| Bottleneck Type | Key Indicators | Reference |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| CPU-bound | High script time, physics overhead | [performance.md](references/performance.md#optimization-workflow) §Optimization-Workflow |
| GPU-bound | Draw calls, overdraw, shader complexity | [performance.md](references/performance.md#optimization-workflow) §Optimization-Workflow |
| Memory | VRAM usage, texture size, mesh count | [performance.md](references/performance.md#optimization-workflow) §Optimization-Workflow |

**MANDATORY READ**: Load [performance.md](references/performance.md) before optimizing — measure first, then target the largest bottleneck — and [`references/lighting.md`](references/lighting.md) for Quest optimization.
**Do NOT Load**: `references/audio-video.md`, `references/upload.md`.

---

## Lighting

### Baked Lighting (Default)

```text
✅ Recommended settings:
├── Lightmapper: Progressive GPU
├── Lightmap Resolution: 10-20 texels/unit (PC) / 5-10 (Quest)
├── Light Mode: Baked by default; use Mixed/Realtime only when the effect is necessary and measured
└── Light Probes: Place along player paths

❌ Avoid:
├── Realtime lights (dynamic shadows)
├── High-resolution lightmaps (memory consumption)
└── Excessive Reflection Probes
```

**MANDATORY READ** [`references/lighting.md`](references/lighting.md) when configuring lightmaps or light probe placement.
**Do NOT Load**: `references/audio-video.md`, `references/upload.md`, `references/layers.md`.

---

## Audio & Video

### VRC_SpatialAudioSource

Plan each world `AudioSource` with a `VRC_SpatialAudioSource`: a bare `AudioSource` triggers a VRChat SDK Build Panel warning. Add the companion deliberately, avoid Auto Fix as a blind default, and do not overwrite existing `VRC_SpatialAudioSource` values or tuned `AudioSource` curves unless requested.

| Property              | Description           | Baseline / safe-preserve note |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Gain                  | Volume boost (0-24 dB) | 10 dB is common/default; use 0 dB for warning-only additions to preserve loudness |
| Near                  | Attenuation start     | 0m unless the sound needs an intentional near field |
| Far                   | Attenuation end       | Match existing `maxDistance` or the intended audible range; avoid blind default/Auto Fix ranges |
| Volumetric Radius     | Source spread          | 0m for point sources; set intentionally for wide sources |
| Enable Spatialization | 3D positioning        | false for intentional 2D/global audio; true for authored 3D audio |

When preserving an existing `AudioSource`, keep `volume`, `spatialBlend`, `rolloffMode`, `maxDistance`, and custom curves; use Gain 0 dB; enable `Use AudioSource Volume Curve` for tuned 3D rolloff; match Far to the existing `maxDistance` or intended audible range; and keep Near at 0m unless an existing `minDistance`/Near value was intentionally authored.

### Video Player Selection

| Feature            | AVPro | Unity Video |

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Router

Identify the symptom category and jump to the reference section:

| Symptom Category | Common Cause | Reference |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Player walks through walls / floor | Layer setup not run; geometry not on Environment (11) | [troubleshooting.md §Layer & Collision](references/troubleshooting.md#layer--collision-issues) |
| Can't grab / Pickup not working | Missing Collider, Rigidbody, or VRC_Pickup component | [troubleshooting.md §Component](references/troubleshooting.md#component-issues) |
| Object not syncing / snaps back | Missing VRC_ObjectSync or ownership not transferred | [troubleshooting.md §Networking](references/troubleshooting.md#networking-issues) |
| Can't sit / clips through Station | Missing Collider; Station Enter Player Location needs adjustment | [troubleshooting.md §Component](references/troubleshooting.md#component-issues) |
| Mirror not reflecting | Layers mask missing Player/PlayerLocal/MirrorReflection | [troubleshooting.md §Component](references/troubleshooting.md#component-issues) |
| Build / Upload fails | Missing SceneDescriptor, script errors, layer warnings | [troubleshooting.md §Build](references/troubleshooting.md#build--upload-issues) |
| Performance issues | Mirror ON, realtime lights, uncooked lightmaps | [performance.md](references/performance.md) |
| Works in Editor but fails in VRChat | Editor Play ≠ SDK runtime; use Build & Test | [troubleshooting.md §Editor](references/troubleshooting.md#editor--runtime-discrepancy) |
| UI visible but not clickable | VRC_UIShape on Screen Space / Overlay Canvas (see NEVER #11) | [troubleshooting.md §Editor](references/troubleshooting.md#editor--runtime-discrepancy) |

**MANDATORY READ** [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md) when diagnosing any issue. **Do NOT Load** for non-troubleshooting tasks.

## Templates (`assets/templates/`)

Starter templates for common SDK component patterns. Repository checks cover static checks; import them into the target SDK project, compile, and run Build & Test before use. Adjust Inspector fields and extend the event stubs for your world.

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VRC_Pickup_Rigidbody.cs` | VRC_Pickup with Rigidbody — OnPickup/OnDrop/OnPickupUseDown/OnPickupUseUp events, ownership transfer, audio feedback |
| `VRC_Station_Basic.cs` | VRC_Station controller — OnStationEntered/OnStationExited events, PlayerMobility, force-eject API |
