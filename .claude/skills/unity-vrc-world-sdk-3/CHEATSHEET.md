## Scene Setup

SDK 3.10.5 includes WorldQualitySettings in the VRCWorld sample/default scene.
Inspect the existing component before adding one: Shadowmask Mode applies at
startup even with both Override flags off. See [component setup](references/components.md#worldqualitysettings-sdk-3105).

### Checklist

```text
□ VRCWorld prefab × 1
□ Spawns configured
□ Respawn Height set (below the floor)

## Components

### Required Elements

| Component | Collider | Rigidbody | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| VRC_SceneDescriptor | - | - | World settings |
| VRC_Pickup | Required | Required | Grabbable |
| VRC_Station | Required | - | Sittable |
| VRC_ObjectSync | - | Required | Physics sync |
| VRC_Mirror | - | - | Mirror |

### VRC_Pickup Setup

```text
[GameObject]
├── Collider (IsTrigger recommended)
├── Rigidbody
├── VRC_Pickup
│   ├── Auto Hold: Yes/No (v1.1; AutoDetect is v1.0-only)
│   ├── Pickupable: true
│   └── Allow Theft: true
└── VRC_ObjectSync (for sync)
```

**Events:**
```csharp
OnPickup()           // When grabbed
OnDrop()             // When released
OnPickupUseDown()    // Trigger pressed
OnPickupUseUp()      // Trigger released
```

### VRC_Station Setup

```text
[GameObject]
├── Collider
└── VRC_Station
    ├── Player Mobility: Mobile/Immobilize
    ├── Disable Station Exit: false
    └── Station Enter/Exit Player Location
```

**Udon:**
```csharp
Networking.LocalPlayer.UseAttachedStation();

OnStationEntered(VRCPlayerApi player)
OnStationExited(VRCPlayerApi player)
```

### VRC_ObjectSync

```csharp
VRCObjectSync sync = (VRCObjectSync)GetComponent(typeof(VRCObjectSync));

sync.Respawn();           // Reset to initial position
sync.SetGravity(true);    // Gravity setting
sync.SetKinematic(false); // Physics setting
sync.FlagDiscontinuity(); // On teleport (skip interpolation)
```

### VRC_Mirror

```csharp
// Default OFF + toggle
void Start() => mirrorObject.SetActive(false);

public override void Interact()
{
    mirrorObject.SetActive(!mirrorObject.activeSelf);
}
```

### Contacts (SDK 3.10.4)

```text
VRC Contact Sender / VRC Contact Receiver shapes:
- Sphere: Radius
- Capsule: Radius + Height
- Box: Box Size X/Y/Z axes

Limits are applied after transform scale:
- Sphere/Capsule radius ≤ 3 m
- Box width/height/depth ≤ 6 m

Box-shaped Contact Receiver:
- Use Face Proximity = proximity to the local positive-Z face
```

For Contact Sender / Contact Receiver Udon events and APIs, use
`../../unity-vrc-udon-sharp/references/dynamics.md` instead of this world authoring sheet.

### PhysBones / Global Collision (SDK 3.10.4)

```text
VRCPhysBoneCollider Global Collision:
- World PhysBones can collide with avatar-origin globals when Allow Collision permits
- Avatars can add up to 4 additional global PhysBone colliders
- Worlds have no documented global collider count limit
- Global Collision supports Sphere/Capsule only
- PhysBone Allow Collision rules still apply

World Udon can edit VRCPhysBoneCollider settings; call
ApplyConfigurationChanges() after batched configuration changes.
```

## Layers

### VRChat Reserved Layers

| # | Name | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 0 | Default | General objects |
| 9 | Player | Remote players |
| 10 | PlayerLocal | Local player |
| 11 | Environment | Walls, floors |
| 13 | Pickup | Grabbable objects |
| 14 | PickupNoEnvironment | Pickups that pass through walls |
| 17 | Walkthrough | Walk-through objects |
| 18 | MirrorReflection | Mirror only |
| **22-31** | **User** | **Custom use (names become user0-user9 at runtime)** |

### Layer Masks (Udon)

```csharp
// Get layer mask
int playerMask = 1 << 9;
int envMask = 1 << LayerMask.NameToLayer("Environment");
// NameToLayer is safe only for VRChat-defined names.
// User layers 22-31 are user0-user9 at runtime; use numbers.

// Multiple layers
int combined = (1 << 9) | (1 << 11);

// Exclude
int exceptPlayer = ~(1 << 9);

// Raycast
Physics.Raycast(origin, dir, out hit, distance, playerMask);
```

## Performance

### Starting Budgets

| Item | PC | Quest |
|------|-----|-------|
| Performance criteria | Project-defined | Project-defined |
| Mirrors | 1 (default OFF) | 0-1 |
| Video Players | 1-2 recommended | 1 recommended |
| Realtime Lighting | Profile | Baked by default; profile on the target Android device before keeping realtime lights or shadows |
| World triangles | Set from project needs | Approximately 250,000 total recommended; not an upload limit |
| Materials | Minimize draw calls | Minimize draw calls; no fixed world material limit is documented |
| Texture Size | Set from memory profile | 1024×1024 or smaller is the official rule of thumb |

### Quest Restrictions

| Feature | PC | Quest |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Dynamic Bones | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cloth | ✅ | ❌ |
| Post-Processing | ✅ | ❌ |
| Unity Constraints | ✅ | ✅ Worlds only; profile cost |
| Realtime Shadows | ✅ | ⚠️ Keep only with target-device evidence |

### Optimization Checklist

```text
□ Light baking complete
□ Realtime lighting and shadows profiled on every target device
□ Mirror default OFF
□ Video players kept to 1-2 (recommended)
□ Static Batching enabled
□ Occlusion Culling configured
□ LOD configured
```

---

## Lighting

### Quick Setup

```text
✅ DO:
├── Lightmapper: Progressive GPU
├── Light Mode: Baked / Mixed
├── Light Probes placed
└── Reflection Probes placed

❌ DON'T:
├── Overuse Realtime lights
├── High-resolution lightmaps
└── Overuse dynamic shadows
```

### Lightmap Settings

| Setting | PC | Quest |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Resolution | 20 texels/unit | 10 |
| Size | 2048 | 1024 |
| Directional | Directional | Non-Directional |
| Compress | ✅ | ✅ |

### Light Probes

```text
Placement locations:
✅ Where players walk
✅ Light/dark boundaries
✅ Indoor/outdoor boundaries
✅ Distribute vertically as well

Do NOT place:
❌ Inside walls
❌ Unreachable areas
```

## Audio/Video

### VRC_SpatialAudioSource

Pair world `AudioSource` components with `VRC_SpatialAudioSource` to avoid SDK Build Panel warnings. For warning-only additions, use Gain 0 dB and preserve existing `volume`, `spatialBlend`, rolloff, max distance, custom curves, and 2D/3D intent.

| Property | Baseline | Safe-preserve note |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Gain | 10 dB common default | Use 0 dB when adding only to avoid a warning |
| Near | 0 m | Keep 0 m unless `minDistance` / Near was authored |
| Far | Per use case | Match `maxDistance` or intended audible range; avoid wider Auto Fix ranges |
| Volumetric Radius | 0 m | Set intentionally for wide sources |
| Enable Spatialization | true for 3D | false for intentional 2D/global audio |
| Use AudioSource Volume Curve | false common default | true when preserving authored 3D rolloff |

### Video Player Comparison

| Feature | AVPro | Unity |
|---------|-------|-------|
| YouTube/Twitch | ✅ | ❌ |
| Live Stream | ✅ | ❌ |
| Editor Preview | ❌ | ✅ |
| Quest | ✅ | ✅ |

### Video Events

```csharp
OnVideoStart()
OnVideoEnd()
OnVideoError(VideoError error)
OnVideoReady()
```

### Audio Compression

| Type | Load Method | Quality |
|------|------------|---------|
| BGM | Streaming | 70% |
| SFX | Decompress | 50-70% |
| Ambient | Compressed | 50% |
