# UdonSharp Networking Reference

Comprehensive guide to networking and synchronization in UdonSharp.

**Active support / last verified**: SDK 3.10.5

Older version numbers in this reference record feature introductions or migration facts only; SDK 3.7.1-3.10.4 are not supported or validation targets for this Skill.

> **Warning**: Networking in Udon is a work in progress and can be fragile. Keep implementations simple and test thoroughly with multiple players.
>
> **Best Practice**: "The key to sync is NOT to sync." Minimize synced data and use local calculation where possible.
>
> **SDK 3.8.1+ New Feature**: The `[NetworkCallable]` attribute enables **network events with parameters**. See [Network Events with Parameters](#network-events-with-parameters-sdk-381) for details.

## Sync Methods (BehaviourSyncMode)

Three sync modes provided by VRChat. Specified using the `UdonBehaviourSyncMode` attribute:

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDKBase;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)] // Specify sync mode
public class MySyncedScript : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    // ...
}
```

### Continuous

Automatic synchronization at approximately **10Hz** (10 times per second).

**Characteristics:**
- Auto-transmits synced variables without calling `RequestSerialization()`
- Data limit: approximately **200 bytes** per UdonBehaviour
- Best for: Positions, rotations, continuously changing values

```csharp
[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Continuous)]
public class ContinuousSyncExample : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] public Vector3 position;    // 12 bytes
    [UdonSynced] public Quaternion rotation; // 16 bytes
    [UdonSynced] public float speed;         // 4 bytes
    // Total: 32 bytes (within 200 byte limit)

    void Update()
    {
        if (Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
        {
            position = transform.position;
            rotation = transform.rotation;
            // No RequestSerialization() needed!
        }
        else
        {
            // Apply synced values
            transform.position = position;
            transform.rotation = rotation;
        }
    }
}
```

**Limitations:**
- Limited data capacity (~200 bytes)
- High network overhead due to constant transmission
- Not suitable for large data or infrequent updates

### Manual

Explicit synchronization via `RequestSerialization()` calls.

**Characteristics:**
- Only syncs when `RequestSerialization()` is called
- Data limit: **280,496 bytes (~280KB)** per serialization (increased from 65,024 bytes in an earlier release)
- Best for: Game state, scores, settings, infrequent updates

```csharp
[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class ManualSyncExample : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] public int score;
    [UdonSynced] public int gameState; // Use int/enum for multiple flags
    [UdonSynced] public string playerName;

    public void UpdateScore(int newScore)
    {
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
        {
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);
        }

        score = newScore;
        RequestSerialization(); // Explicit sync required!
    }
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Full control over sync timing
- Much larger data capacity
- Low network overhead for infrequent updates

### NoVariableSync

NoVariableSync disables variable synchronization while keeping network events available.

`BehaviourSyncMode` has both `None` and `NoVariableSync`; `None` also disables `SendCustomNetworkEvent` on the behaviour, while `NoVariableSync` keeps network events working. For event-driven behaviours, use `NoVariableSync`. Source: UdonSharp source XML docs (verified SDK 3.10.3).

**Characteristics:**
- No synced variables supported (`[UdonSynced]` will error)
- Must use `SendCustomNetworkEvent()` for communication
- Best for: Local-only logic, event-driven communication, reducing network overhead

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.NoVariableSync)]
public class NoSyncExample : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private const float ReceiverCooldown = 1f;
    private float lastAcceptedEventTime = float.MinValue;

    // Cannot use [UdonSynced] with NoVariableSync mode!
    // [UdonSynced] private int score; // ERROR!

    public void _TriggerGlobalEvent()
    {
        SendCustomNetworkEvent(
            NetworkEventTarget.All,
            nameof(_OnGlobalEvent)
        );
    }

    [NetworkCallable(1)]
    public void _OnGlobalEvent()
    {
        if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

        VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
        if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

        // Open diagnostic policy: any valid caller may request a log entry.
        // The receiver cooldown bounds aggregate execution across all callers.
        if (Time.time - lastAcceptedEventTime < ReceiverCooldown) return;
        lastAcceptedEventTime = Time.time;
        Debug.Log("Event received!");
    }
}
```

**When to use NoVariableSync:**
- Purely event-based systems (buttons, triggers)
- Objects that only need notifications, not state synchronization
- Reducing network overhead in complex worlds

### Mode Selection Guide

| Mode | Data size | Frequency | Use case |
|--------|-------------|------|-------------|
| Continuous | ~200 bytes | High (10Hz) | Position/rotation tracking |
| Manual | ~280KB (280,496 bytes) | On-demand | Game state, scores, settings |
| NoVariableSync | N/A | N/A | Event-only communication |

## VRC_ObjectSync Warning

> **Critical**: When using `VRC_ObjectSync` component alongside `UdonBehaviour`, be aware of sync freezing!

When a physics object with `VRC_ObjectSync` stops moving (becomes stationary), the sync system stops transmitting. **This also affects coexisting UdonBehaviour synced variables!**

```csharp
// PROBLEM: Object stops -> Udon sync also freezes
public class ProblematicPickup : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] public int useCount; // May stop syncing when object is stationary!

    public override void OnPickupUseDown()
    {
        useCount++;
        RequestSerialization(); // Might not transmit if object is still!
    }
}
```

**Workarounds:**
1. **Separate UdonBehaviour**: Place sync logic on a separate GameObject without VRC_ObjectSync
2. **Use network events**: Use `SendCustomNetworkEvent()` for critical updates
3. **Force movement**: Apply minimal velocity to maintain sync (not recommended)

```csharp
// SOLUTION: Separate synced logic from physics object
public class SeparatedSyncLogic : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    // This script is on a SEPARATE GameObject without VRC_ObjectSync
    [UdonSynced] public int useCount;

    public void _IncrementUse()
    {
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
        {
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);
        }
        useCount++;
        RequestSerialization(); // Now works reliably
    }
}
```

## Late Joiner Considerations

When a player joins mid-session, synced data behaves differently:

### Synced Variables (Automatic)

Synced variables are **automatically sent** to late joiners:

```csharp
[UdonSynced] private int gameScore;     // Auto-synced to late joiners
[UdonSynced] private bool isGameActive; // Auto-synced to late joiners

// Late joiners receive current values via OnDeserialization
public override void OnDeserialization()
{
    UpdateGameDisplay();
}
```

### Network Events (Manual Handling Required)

Network events are **not re-sent** to late joiners:

```csharp
// PROBLEM: Late joiners miss this event
public void _StartGame()
{
    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
    SendCustomNetworkEvent(NetworkEventTarget.All, nameof(_OnGameStarted));
}

[NetworkCallable(1)]
public void _OnGameStarted()
{
    if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

    VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
    if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

    VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(gameObject);
    if (owner == null || !owner.IsValid()) return;
    if (caller.playerId != owner.playerId) return;

    // Even an authorized event is not replayed to late joiners.
    ShowGameUI();
}
```

**Solution: Use synced variables for state**

```csharp
[UdonSynced, FieldChangeCallback(nameof(GamePhase))]
private int _gamePhase = 0;

public int GamePhase
{
    get => _gamePhase;
    set
    {
        _gamePhase = value;
        OnGamePhaseChanged(); // Called for late joiners via OnDeserialization
    }
}

private void OnGamePhaseChanged()
{
    switch (_gamePhase)
    {
        case 0: ShowLobbyUI(); break;
        case 1: ShowGameUI(); break;
        case 2: ShowResultsUI(); break;
    }
}

public void _StartGame()
{
    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
    GamePhase = 1;
    RequestSerialization();
}
```

### Side-Effect Guard for Late Joiners

When a late joiner enters a world, `OnDeserialization` fires for all synced variables. If side effects (audio, animations, particles) are triggered directly in `OnDeserialization`, they will play unintentionally on join.

#### The `_hasReceivedState` Flag Pattern

Use a first-sync flag to skip side effects on the first `OnDeserialization` call. (Distinct from the `_isInitialized` guard in events.md, which tracks `Start()` completion — this flag tracks whether the first synced state has been received.)

```csharp
[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class SafeSyncedObject : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced, FieldChangeCallback(nameof(GameState))]
    private int _gameState;

    public AudioSource sfx;
    public Animator animator;

    private bool _hasReceivedState = false;

    public int GameState
    {
        get => _gameState;
        set
        {
            int previousState = _gameState;
            _gameState = value;
            ApplyState(previousState);
        }
    }

    public override void OnDeserialization()
    {
        if (!_hasReceivedState)
        {
            _hasReceivedState = true;
            // First deserialization (late joiner): apply state silently
            ApplyStateWithoutSideEffects();
            return;
        }
        // Subsequent deserializations: side effects are handled by
        // FieldChangeCallback (GameState property setter), not here
    }

    private void ApplyState(int previousState)
    {
        // Update visuals (always safe)
        UpdateDisplay();

        // Side effects only after initialization
        if (_hasReceivedState && previousState != _gameState)
        {
            sfx.Play();
            animator.SetTrigger("StateChange");
        }
    }

    private void ApplyStateWithoutSideEffects()
    {
        UpdateDisplay();
    }

    private void UpdateDisplay() { /* Update UI/visuals */ }
}
```

#### Using `OnDeserialization(DeserializationResult)` Overload

The overloaded `OnDeserialization(DeserializationResult)` provides timing context (`sendTime`, `receiveTime`) and storage origin (`isFromStorage`). These fields are useful for latency analysis and storage-restored data detection, but **do not directly identify late-joiner initial sync**. Use the `_hasReceivedState` flag pattern for late-joiner guards:

##### DeserializationResult Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `sendTime` | `float` | Time (in seconds, server clock) when the owner sent this update |
| `receiveTime` | `float` | Time (in seconds, server clock) when this client received the update |
| `isFromStorage` | `bool` | True if the data was restored from persistent storage rather than sent live |

```csharp
public override void OnDeserialization(DeserializationResult result)
{
    // Update visuals (always safe)
    UpdateDisplay();

    // Calculate network latency when valid timing data is available
    if (result.receiveTime > result.sendTime)
    {
        float latencySeconds = result.receiveTime - result.sendTime;
        Debug.Log($"Network latency: {latencySeconds * 1000f:F1} ms");
    }

    // Guard side effects: skip on initial sync for late joiners
    // Note: DeserializationResult does not provide a late-joiner flag;
    // use _hasReceivedState for this purpose
    if (!_hasReceivedState)
    {
        _hasReceivedState = true;
        return;
    }

    // Runtime update: play effects
    PlayTransitionEffects();
}
```

> **Guard**: Always check `receiveTime > sendTime` before computing latency. In edge cases (storage restore, clock skew), `sendTime` may be zero or greater than `receiveTime`.

> **Common pitfall**: Without this guard, a late joiner entering a multiplayer game will hear all audio cues and see all animations replay simultaneously. This was a reported issue in real-world VRChat game development.

## Optimization Tips

### Use Integers/Enums for Multiple Flags

Instead of syncing multiple bools, pack them into a single integer:

```csharp
// BAD: Multiple synced bools
[UdonSynced] private bool hasKey;
[UdonSynced] private bool hasSword;
[UdonSynced] private bool hasShield;
[UdonSynced] private bool hasPotion;

// GOOD: Single synced integer with bit flags
[UdonSynced] private int inventory;

private const int FLAG_KEY = 1;
private const int FLAG_SWORD = 2;
private const int FLAG_SHIELD = 4;
private const int FLAG_POTION = 8;

public bool HasKey => (inventory & FLAG_KEY) != 0;
public bool HasSword => (inventory & FLAG_SWORD) != 0;

public void AddItem(int flag)
{
    inventory |= flag;
    RequestSerialization();
}
```

### Prefer Local Calculation Over Sync

Calculate locally when possible:

```csharp
// BAD: Syncing calculated value
[UdonSynced] private float elapsedTime;

void Update()
{
    if (Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
    {
        elapsedTime += Time.deltaTime;
        RequestSerialization(); // Too frequent!
    }
}

// GOOD: Sync start time, calculate locally
[UdonSynced] private double startServerTime;

void Update()
{
    if (startServerTime > 0)
    {
        float elapsed = (float)(Networking.GetServerTimeInSeconds() - startServerTime);
        timerDisplay.text = elapsed.ToString("F1");
    }
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Ownership Model

Every GameObject with an UdonBehaviour has a network owner:

- **Default owner**: Instance master (first player to join)
- **One owner per object**: Ownership is per-GameObject, not per-component
- **Only owner can modify**: Only the owner can change synced variables

```csharp
// Check if local player is owner
if (Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
{
    // Safe to modify synced variables
}

// Get current owner
VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(gameObject);
Debug.Log($"Owner: {owner.displayName}");
```

### Ownership Transfer

```csharp
// Request ownership for the local player.
// Locally immediate — IsOwner(gameObject) returns true after this call.
Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);
```

**Set owner if needed and update synced state in one call:**

```csharp
public void RequestOwnershipAndUpdate(int newValue)
{
    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
    {
        Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);
    }

    syncedValue = newValue;
    RequestSerialization();
}

// OnOwnershipTransferred remains useful for inheritance scenarios
// (e.g., the previous owner left and you became owner without a
// SetOwner call of your own). For SetOwner-initiated transfers, the
// callback fires synchronously inside SetOwner — usually you do not
// need to write code in it for the calling-side path.
public override void OnOwnershipTransferred(VRCPlayerApi player)
{
    if (player.isLocal)
    {
        // Re-broadcast state so non-owner clients converge.
        RequestSerialization();
    }
}
```

### Ownership Transfer Timing Semantics

- **On the calling client:** `Networking.SetOwner` takes effect immediately. `Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)` returns `true` synchronously after the call. `OnOwnershipTransferred` fires synchronously within the `SetOwner` stack on the calling client.
- **On remote clients:** the new ownership becomes visible after VRChat propagates the change. Each remote client's `OnOwnershipTransferred` fires when the propagation arrives.
- **No client-side arbitration:** when two clients call `SetOwner` simultaneously, both succeed locally and may write synced variables; VRChat resolves the durable owner by network arrival order. The loser's write is overwritten when the winner's serialization arrives. This is by design — see [networking-antipatterns.md §1](networking-antipatterns.md#1-ownership-race-condition) for the recommended `IsOwner`-guarded pattern, and [§"Ownership Arbitration with OnOwnershipRequest"](#ownership-arbitration-with-onownershiprequest) below for owner-side protection during critical actions.

> *Footnote: Pre-2021.2.2 SDKs treated `SetOwner` as asynchronous on the calling client; the active target (SDK 3.10.5) is locally immediate. Source: [Ownership Transfer Events](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/ownership/#transfer-events-diagram).*

### Owner Leave and Ownership Cascade

When the owner of a networked GameObject disconnects:

1. **VRChat automatically assigns a new owner** — the exact selection rule is not publicly documented; do not assume a specific player will be chosen
2. **`OnOwnershipTransferred` fires** on all clients with the new owner
3. **Synced variables are preserved** — they are not reset when ownership transfers

```csharp
public override void OnOwnershipTransferred(VRCPlayerApi player)
{
    if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;

    if (player.isLocal)
    {
        // We became the new owner (e.g., previous owner left)
        // Resume game logic that only the owner should run
        Debug.Log("Inherited ownership — resuming owner duties");
        RequestSerialization(); // Re-broadcast current state
    }
}

public override void OnPlayerLeft(VRCPlayerApi player)
{
    if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;

    // Clean up player-specific data
    // Note: If this player was the owner, OnOwnershipTransferred
    // will fire separately with the new owner
    RemovePlayerFromGame(player.playerId);
}
```

**Best practices for ownership transitions:**
- Do **not** assume the local player will become the new owner — VRChat decides
- Always re-broadcast state via `RequestSerialization()` when inheriting ownership
- Clean up departing player data in `OnPlayerLeft`, not in `OnOwnershipTransferred`
- If your game logic runs in `Update()` with an owner check, it will automatically resume on the new owner

### Ownership Arbitration with OnOwnershipRequest

`OnOwnershipRequest` allows the current owner to **accept or reject** ownership transfer requests:

```csharp
[UdonSynced] private bool _isProcessingCriticalAction = false; // Shared gate: requester and owner must evaluate identical state.
// The owner sets this flag and calls RequestSerialization() around the critical action.
// A synced gate still has a propagation window — a requester can read a stale value
// until the owner's write deserializes — so keep gated sections short.

public override bool OnOwnershipRequest(
    VRCPlayerApi requestingPlayer,
    VRCPlayerApi requestedOwner)
{
    // Reject ownership transfers during critical game logic using synced state
    if (_isProcessingCriticalAction)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Rejected ownership request from {requestingPlayer.displayName} " +
                  $"— critical action in progress");
        return false;
    }

    // Accept the transfer
    return true;
}
```

**When to use `OnOwnershipRequest`:**

| Scenario | Return |
|----------|--------|
| Default (no override) | Always accepts (`true`) |
| During critical game state transitions | Reject (`false`) until complete |
| Turn-based game during active turn | Reject (`false`) until turn ends |
| Free-for-all interaction | Accept (`true`) |

> **Important**: `OnOwnershipRequest` runs locally on **both the requester and the current owner** (per the official [Network Components page](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/network-components/): "This logic runs locally on both the requester and the owner"). The logic must return the same result on both sides to avoid desync. If the current owner has disconnected, the callback is not invoked — VRChat auto-assigns directly.
>
> The two parameters are `VRCPlayerApi requestingPlayer` (the player calling `SetOwner`) and `VRCPlayerApi requestedOwner` (the player being assigned ownership — typically the same as `requestingPlayer` for self-promotion, but can differ when one client transfers ownership to another).

## Synced Variables

### Basic Synchronization

Use the `[UdonSynced]` attribute to synchronize fields:

```csharp
[UdonSynced] private int score;
[UdonSynced] private float health;
[UdonSynced] private bool isActive;
[UdonSynced] private Vector3 position;
[UdonSynced] private string playerName; // 2 bytes/char; keep short in Continuous mode (~200 byte shared budget)
```

### Sync Modes

```csharp
// Default: Sync when changed (no interpolation)
[UdonSynced]
private int normalSync;

// Linear interpolation for continuous values
[UdonSynced(UdonSyncMode.Linear)]
private Vector3 linearPosition; // Interpolates between updates

// Smooth damped interpolation
[UdonSynced(UdonSyncMode.Smooth)]
private Quaternion smoothRotation; // Smoothly interpolates

// With FieldChangeCallback (called on value change)
[UdonSynced, FieldChangeCallback(nameof(SmoothPosition))]
private Vector3 _smoothPosition;
public Vector3 SmoothPosition
{
    get => _smoothPosition;
    set
    {
        _smoothPosition = value;
        // Handle smooth interpolation here
    }
}
```

**UdonSyncMode values:**

| Mode | Description | Best for |
|--------|------|-----------|
| `UdonSyncMode.None` | No interpolation (default) | Discrete values, flags, state |
| `UdonSyncMode.Linear` | Linear interpolation between updates | Position, rotation, continuous values |
| `UdonSyncMode.Smooth` | Smooth damped interpolation | Cameras, slow movement, UI elements |

**Important:** Interpolation modes only affect how the receiving client applies values between network updates. Sync frequency is determined by BehaviourSyncMode (Continuous ~10Hz, Manual on-demand).

### Requesting Serialization

After changing synced variables, call `RequestSerialization()`:

```csharp
public void _IncrementScore()
{
    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
    {
        // SetOwner is locally immediate — IsOwner is true after this returns.
        Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);
    }

    score += 10;
    RequestSerialization(); // Broadcast to all players
}
```

### Detecting Changes

For scalar synced values, use `OnDeserialization` or `FieldChangeCallback`:

```csharp
// Method 1: OnDeserialization
[UdonSynced] private int score;

public override void OnDeserialization()
{
    // Called when synced data is received
    UpdateScoreDisplay();
}

// Method 2: FieldChangeCallback (more granular)
[UdonSynced, FieldChangeCallback(nameof(Health))]
private float _health;

public float Health
{
    get => _health;
    set
    {
        _health = value;
        OnHealthChanged();
    }
}

private void OnHealthChanged()
{
    healthBar.value = _health;
}
```

### Synced Arrays: Apply Them After Deserialization

`FieldChangeCallback` is useful for scalar synced fields, but it is not a
receiver contract for arrays. The official [`OnVariableChanged` guidance](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/network-components/#onvariablechanged)
states that changing an array's contents does not trigger the event because the
array itself is unchanged. The official [Udon Example Scene](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/examples/udon-example-scene/)
uses `OnDeserialization()` for its array example for the same reason.

Do not depend on `FieldChangeCallback` for same-length element changes, array reassignments, or array length changes. Reassignment and length changes are not special exceptions to this guidance; use one receiver path for every synced array shape. The owner applies the same idempotent method immediately after the mutation, and remote clients apply it from `OnDeserialization()` after the serialized snapshot is complete. For Manual sync, make all element writes (or a single array reassignment) first, then make one `RequestSerialization()` after the complete array update.

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDKBase;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class SyncedArrayReceiver : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] private int[] _syncedValues = new int[4];

    public void _SetValues(int[] values)
    {
        if (values == null) return;

        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);

        _syncedValues = values;
        ApplyValues();
        RequestSerialization();
    }

    public override void OnDeserialization()
    {
        ApplyValues();
    }

    private void ApplyValues()
    {
        if (_syncedValues == null) return;

        // Idempotent projection: derive the local display from the snapshot.
        UpdateDisplay(_syncedValues);
    }

    private void UpdateDisplay(int[] values)
    {
        // Update UI or other derived state from values.
    }
}
```

The basic pattern intentionally has no revision counter: `ApplyValues()` is
safe to run again for the same state. Add a revision only when the apply step
has a non-idempotent side effect, such as playing a sound or writing a one-time
record. A revision does not establish ordering or stale-packet rejection; it is
only a duplicate-side-effect guard shared by the owner and `OnDeserialization`
paths. A late joiner's first `OnDeserialization()` receives the current revision,
so record the first received revision as a baseline without replaying historical one-shot effects.
Durable state must still be projected by `ApplyValues()` before the
baseline return; only later revisions may trigger the one-shot.

```csharp
// Optional guard for a non-idempotent effect; keep the basic path revision-free.
[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class RevisionGuardedArray : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] private int[] _syncedValues = new int[4];
    [UdonSynced] private int _revision;
    [SerializeField] private AudioSource _sound;
    private int _appliedRevision;
    private bool _hasAppliedRevision;

    private void Start()
    {
        // The owner has already applied its local baseline; receivers have not.
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
        _hasAppliedRevision = true;
        _appliedRevision = _revision;
    }

    public void _SetValues(int[] values)
    {
        if (values == null) return;
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
            Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);

        _syncedValues = values;
        _revision++;
        ApplyValues();
        ApplyOneShotIfNeeded();
        RequestSerialization();
    }

    public override void OnDeserialization()
    {
        // Durable UI/state is never suppressed by the one-shot baseline.
        ApplyValues();
        ApplyOneShotIfNeeded();
    }

    private void ApplyValues()
    {
        if (_syncedValues == null) return;
        UpdateDisplay(_syncedValues);
    }

    private void ApplyOneShotIfNeeded()
    {
        if (!_hasAppliedRevision)
        {
            // Late joiner: record the first received revision only.
            _hasAppliedRevision = true;
            _appliedRevision = _revision;
            return;
        }
        if (_appliedRevision == _revision) return;

        _appliedRevision = _revision;
        PlayOneShot();
    }

    private void UpdateDisplay(int[] values) { /* Durable projection. */ }
    private void PlayOneShot() { if (_sound != null) _sound.Play(); }
}
```

Increment `_revision` with the array mutation, then call the same
`ApplyOneShotIfNeeded()` helper on the owner and from `OnDeserialization()` on
receivers. The owner starts with its local revision baseline, while a receiver
records the first snapshot as a baseline. Use this only for the non-idempotent
effect; keep ordinary UI or derived-state updates on the revision-free
`ApplyValues()` path above.

## Network Events

### SendCustomNetworkEvent (Legacy Compatibility)

Legacy dispatch resolves a parameterless public method by name. Historical
worlds used unprefixed entries such as `OnButtonPressed`; that shape has no
attribute rate limit and should remain compatibility-only, not a new example.

For SDK 3.8.1+, expose the receiver deliberately and validate the active caller:

```csharp
SendCustomNetworkEvent(
    VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces.NetworkEventTarget.All,
    nameof(_OnButtonPressed)
);

[NetworkCallable(2)]
public void _OnButtonPressed()
{
    if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

    VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
    if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

    // Open cosmetic policy: any valid caller may play this bounded effect.
    Debug.Log("Button pressed!");
}

public void _ApplyLocalPreview()
{
    Debug.Log("Local preview only");
}
```

**NetworkEventTarget options**:

| Target | SDK | Description |
|-----------|-----|------|
| `NetworkEventTarget.All` | All versions | All players including self |
| `NetworkEventTarget.Owner` | All versions | Object owner only |
| `NetworkEventTarget.Others` | **3.8.1+** | All players except self |
| `NetworkEventTarget.Self` | **3.8.1+** | Self only (equivalent to local execution) |

> **SDK 3.8.1+ new targets**: `NetworkEventTarget.Others` sends to "everyone except the sender", preventing duplicate effect/sound playback. `NetworkEventTarget.Self` can be used for local-only processing.

A parameterless public UdonSharp method whose name does not start with `_` remains exposed to legacy `SendCustomNetworkEvent` calls even without `[NetworkCallable]`.

A legacy parameterless public method may return a value, but remote dispatch discards that value; the method remains network attack surface and the audit includes it.

A leading underscore blocks legacy network calls to a public method.

`[NetworkCallable]` explicitly exposes an underscore-prefixed public method to network calls.

**Limitations (Legacy)**:
- Cannot send parameters with network events
- Cannot directly target specific players (Others/Self added in SDK 3.8.1+)
- Events may arrive before synced variable updates (race condition!)
- Calls from different senders can interleave; do not use event order as authorization or persistent state

---

## Network Event Hardening and Sender Authorization

Treat the name and parameters of every network event as caller-controlled input. In particular, a `playerId`, display name, role flag, or claimed identity passed as a parameter must never authorize a privileged action. Read the sender from the active network-call context, then apply an explicit policy owned by the world.

`NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer` and `NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall` are available in SDK 3.8.1+ for both attributed and legacy network events.

`NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall` remains true through nested methods and cross-behaviour calls until the network entry method returns.

`NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer` is null or invalid outside a network call.

Caller authorization and receiver ownership are separate checks: authorize `NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer`, then use `Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)` to guard synced mutation on the receiver.

A direct local method call is not a network call. Require `InNetworkCall` when a method must only accept network-originated requests.

> **Official warning:** Instance master is for gameplay/session arbitration, not security or access control. Do not use `isMaster` as an authorization boundary. VRChat's [Object Ownership](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/ownership/) and [Network Components](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/networking/network-components/) documentation explicitly warns against using master to gate access.

The following complete example uses an owner-only caller policy. Sender authorization is evaluated against the object owner, while the receiver separately verifies that it is the local owner before mutating synced state.

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class NetworkHardenedReset : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] private int roundNumber;

    // Local-only event target: callable by local UI or code, but not by a
    // legacy SendCustomNetworkEvent. Do not add [NetworkCallable].
    public void _RequestRoundReset()
    {
        SendCustomNetworkEvent(
            NetworkEventTarget.Owner,
            nameof(_OwnerResetRound)
        );
    }

    // [NetworkCallable] explicitly exposes the underscore-prefixed entry point.
    [NetworkCallable]
    public void _OwnerResetRound()
    {
        if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

        VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
        if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

        VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(gameObject);
        if (owner == null || !owner.IsValid()) return;
        if (caller.playerId != owner.playerId) return;

        // Keep this receiver-side guard for synced state. It authorizes where
        // mutation happens; it does not authenticate or authorize the caller.
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;

        _ResetRoundState();
        RequestSerialization();
    }

    // Local-only helper: underscore-prefixed and not [NetworkCallable].
    private void _ResetRoundState()
    {
        roundNumber = 0;
    }
}
```

## Network Events with Parameters (SDK 3.8.1+)

The `[NetworkCallable]` attribute added in **SDK 3.8.1** enables sending **up to 8 parameters** with network events.

SDKs before 3.8.1 do not define the `NetworkCallable` attribute or parameterized network-event API, so code that uses them normally fails to compile.

`NetworkCallableAttribute` is in the `VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling` namespace. Add `using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;` to full scripts that use `[NetworkCallable]`.

### [NetworkCallable] Attribute

Methods callable over the network require the `[NetworkCallable]` attribute:

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class OwnerControlledDamage : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] private int health = 100;

    [NetworkCallable]
    public void _TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

        VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
        if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

        VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(gameObject);
        if (owner == null || !owner.IsValid()) return;
        if (caller.playerId != owner.playerId) return;
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
        if (damage <= 0 || damage > 25) return;

        health = Mathf.Max(0, health - damage);
        RequestSerialization();
    }

    public void _SendDamage(int damage)
    {
        SendCustomNetworkEvent(
            NetworkEventTarget.Owner,
            nameof(_TakeDamage),
            damage
        );
    }
}
```

### [NetworkCallable] Constraints

| Constraint | Details |
|------|------|
| `public` required | Method must be public |
| `[NetworkCallable]` required | Without the attribute, parameters cannot be received |
| `void` return required | A `[NetworkCallable]` method must return `void`. |
| `static` not allowed | Static methods cannot be used |
| `virtual`/`override` not allowed | Virtual methods cannot be used |
| Simple method declaration only | Generic, abstract, extern, async, sealed, operator, and explicit-interface forms are not allowed |
| No overloading | A `[NetworkCallable]` name cannot be shared with another method, even one without the attribute; ordinary direct-call overloads are supported |
| Maximum 8 parameters | More than 8 parameters not allowed |
| No by-reference parameters | `ref`, `out`, and `in` parameters are not allowed |
| No `params` parameters | Parameter arrays declared with `params` are not allowed |
| No default parameter values | Every argument must be supplied explicitly |
| Syncable types only | Parameters limited to syncable types |

### Rate Limiting

`[NetworkCallable]` accepts an optional integer parameter that controls how many remote sends per second the sender may dispatch for that event on that behaviour. Sends above that pace wait in the sender's event queue.

```csharp
// Default: 5 calls/sec per event per behaviour (no argument)
[NetworkCallable]
public void _NormalEvent(int value) { }

// Custom rate: 100 calls/sec (maximum allowed)
[NetworkCallable(100)]
public void _HighFrequencyEvent(float value) { }

// Low rate: 1 remote send/sec for this event on this behaviour
[NetworkCallable(1)]
public void _RareBroadcast(string message) { }
```

`[NetworkCallable(N)]` paces remote sends for one event on one behaviour and queues excess sends on the sender. It is not an aggregate receiver or resource bound across callers. Local and `NetworkEventTarget.Self` execution bypass the rate limit, while `NetworkEventTarget.All` can fan one send out to many receiver executions. The limit also does not bound the work performed by one accepted call. Sender-side queue queries describe the current sender's queue, not aggregate work at receivers. Use receiver-local cooldowns, idempotence, fixed-capacity storage, deduplication, and per-call input validation wherever aggregate resource use matters.

The default rate is **5 calls/sec** and the configurable maximum is **100 calls/sec**. A rate-limit disagreement between players running different versions of the same world is the documented non-malicious drop scenario. Separately, server-side enforcement also protects against malicious use; that protection is not a delivery guarantee for accepted or queued events.

### Types Usable as Parameters

Only types syncable with `[UdonSynced]` can be used as parameters:

| Type | Size | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `bool` | 1 byte | |
| `char` | 2 bytes | |
| `byte`, `sbyte` | 1 byte | |
| `short`, `ushort` | 2 bytes | |
| `int`, `uint` | 4 bytes | |
| `long`, `ulong` | 8 bytes | |
| `float` | 4 bytes | |
| `double` | 8 bytes | |
| `string` | 2 bytes/char | No fixed per-string limit; bounded by NetworkCallable event payload (16 KB/event max, ~18 KB/s throughput). Events >1024 bytes are split into multiple internal packets. Independent of `[UdonSynced]` sync mode budgets. |
| `Vector2/3/4` | 8/12/16 bytes | |
| `Quaternion` | 16 bytes | |
| `Color`, `Color32` | 16/4 bytes | |
| Arrays of above | variable | |

**Not usable**: `GameObject`, `Transform`, `VRCPlayerApi`, custom classes

### Practical Pattern: Damage System

For a full `[NetworkCallable]`-based damage request that validates sender context, applies an example session policy, and keeps the receiver ownership guard, see `DamageReceiver` in [patterns-networking.md](patterns-networking.md#networkcallable-patterns-sdk-381).

### Legacy vs NetworkCallable Comparison

| Feature | Legacy | NetworkCallable (3.8.1+) |
|------|--------|--------------------------|
| Sending parameters | Not possible | Up to 8 |
| Attribute | Not required for parameterless public methods without `_` | `[NetworkCallable]` required; explicitly exposes methods even when their name starts with `_` |
| Rate limiting | None | Configurable (1-100/sec) |
| Backward compatibility | All versions | SDK 3.8.1+ only |

### Migration Guide

**Before (historical compatibility, do not copy):** Older worlds wrote damage
to a synced field, requested serialization, then invoked an unprefixed public
entry by name. The event could arrive before the field update, and the legacy
entry had no attribute rate limit or reliable caller policy.

**After (NetworkCallable):**

```csharp
[NetworkCallable(1)]
public void _Attack(int damage)
{
    if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

    VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
    if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

    if (damage <= 0 || damage > 25) return;

    VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(gameObject);
    if (owner == null || !owner.IsValid()) return;
    if (caller.playerId != owner.playerId) return;
    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;

    _ProcessDamage(damage, caller);
}

public void _TriggerAttack(int damage)
{
    SendCustomNetworkEvent(
        NetworkEventTarget.Owner,
        nameof(_Attack),
        damage
    );
}

private void _ProcessDamage(int damage, VRCPlayerApi caller)
{
    // Validate damage and caller according to this world's rules.
}
```

### Race Condition Between Network Events and Synced Variables

**Critical issue**: When sending a network event and updating synced variables simultaneously, the event may arrive before the synced variable update on remote clients:

```csharp
// PROBLEM: Event may arrive before syncedData is updated on remote clients
public void _SendDataWithEvent()
{
    syncedData = "important data";
    RequestSerialization();
    SendCustomNetworkEvent(NetworkEventTarget.All, nameof(_ProcessDataEvent));
}

[NetworkCallable(1)]
public void _ProcessDataEvent()
{
    if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

    VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
    if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

    VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(gameObject);
    if (owner == null || !owner.IsValid()) return;
    if (caller.playerId != owner.playerId) return;

    // syncedData might still be the OLD value here!
    Debug.Log(syncedData); // Might print old data!
}
```

**Solution: Use FieldChangeCallback instead of events**

```csharp
[UdonSynced, FieldChangeCallback(nameof(SyncedData))]
private string _syncedData;

public string SyncedData
{
    get => _syncedData;
    set
    {
        _syncedData = value;
        ProcessData(); // Called after data is actually updated
    }
}

public void _SendData()
{
    SyncedData = "important data";
    RequestSerialization();
    // No need for network event - FieldChangeCallback handles it
}

private void ProcessData()
{
    // syncedData is guaranteed to be the new value here
    Debug.Log(_syncedData);
}
```

### Workaround: Targeting Specific Players

Since direct player targeting is not available, include the target player's ID as a `[NetworkCallable]` parameter and let each receiver filter locally. This complete example uses an open caller policy and attributes the displayed sender only from the validated call context:

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.NoVariableSync)]
public class TargetedMessageExample : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private const int MaxMessageLength = 256;
    private const float ReceiverCooldown = 0.5f;
    private float lastAcceptedMessageTime = float.MinValue;

    public void _SendMessageToPlayer(VRCPlayerApi player, string message)
    {
        if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(message) || message.Length > MaxMessageLength) return;

        SendCustomNetworkEvent(
            NetworkEventTarget.All,
            nameof(_CheckMessage),
            player.playerId,
            message
        );
    }

    [NetworkCallable(2)]
    public void _CheckMessage(int targetPlayerId, string message)
    {
        if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

        VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
        if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

        // Open caller policy: any valid caller may send a bounded message.
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(message) || message.Length > MaxMessageLength) return;

        VRCPlayerApi localPlayer = Networking.LocalPlayer;
        if (localPlayer == null || !localPlayer.IsValid()) return;
        if (localPlayer.playerId != targetPlayerId) return;

        // This local cooldown bounds aggregate display work from all callers.
        if (Time.time - lastAcceptedMessageTime < ReceiverCooldown) return;
        lastAcceptedMessageTime = Time.time;
        _ProcessMessage(message, caller);
    }

    private void _ProcessMessage(string message, VRCPlayerApi caller)
    {
        Debug.Log($"{caller.displayName}: {message}");
    }
}
```

Passing both the target and payload as event parameters avoids the synced-variable/event ordering race described above. For pre-3.8.1 SDKs, use synced variables and react in `OnDeserialization`/`FieldChangeCallback`, not in a paired network event.

The 256-character maximum is this receiver example's policy, not a VRChat platform limit.

This `targetPlayerId` is routing data only. It identifies which receiver should act; it does not identify or authorize the sender. Any privileged handling must separately use `NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer` and a world-specific authorization policy.

## Data Limits

### String Length

Synced strings have no fixed character limit. The practical limit depends on sync buffer size and UTF-16 encoding (2 bytes per character):
- **Continuous**: ~200 bytes per serialization (shared across all synced fields on the behaviour)
- **Manual**: 280,496 bytes (~280KB) per serialization

```csharp
// Keep synced strings short to conserve sync buffer
[UdonSynced] private string status; // "ready", "waiting", etc.

// For longer data, split across multiple variables
[UdonSynced] private string data1;
[UdonSynced] private string data2;
[UdonSynced] private string data3;
```

### Bandwidth Limits

VRChat limits network data rate. Excessive synchronization causes "Death Runs" (data loss):

```csharp
// WRONG - Too frequent updates
void Update()
{
    position = transform.position;
    RequestSerialization(); // Every frame = bad!
}

// CORRECT - Throttle updates
private float lastSyncTime;
private const float SYNC_INTERVAL = 0.1f; // 10 times per second max

void Update()
{
    if (Time.time - lastSyncTime > SYNC_INTERVAL)
    {
        if (HasPositionChanged())
        {
            position = transform.position;
            RequestSerialization();
            lastSyncTime = Time.time;
        }
    }
}
```

## Object Pooling

Runtime-instantiated objects are never network-synced (`Object.Instantiate` results are local-only). Use object pooling — pre-placed GameObjects for synced objects, or a pool built once in `Start()` for local-only objects (see patterns-networking.md).

For full implementations, see:
- Simple pool: [patterns-networking.md](patterns-networking.md#object-pooling)
- Master-managed player pool: [assets/templates/MasterManagedPlayerPool.cs](../assets/templates/MasterManagedPlayerPool.cs)

## Player Events

```csharp
public override void OnPlayerJoined(VRCPlayerApi player)
{
    if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;

    Debug.Log($"{player.displayName} joined");
}

public override void OnPlayerLeft(VRCPlayerApi player)
{
    if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;

    Debug.Log($"{player.displayName} left");

    // Handle ownership transfer if the owner left
    // VRChat automatically assigns a new owner
}

public override void OnOwnershipTransferred(VRCPlayerApi player)
{
    if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;

    Debug.Log($"New owner: {player.displayName}");

    if (player.isLocal)
    {
        // We are now the owner, can modify synced variables
    }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Master-Coordinated Session Work

Master status selects a session coordinator; it never authorizes a request. Use it only for non-security, idempotent work such as reconciling session slots. Any network-originated request still requires `InNetworkCall`, a valid `CallingPlayer`, and an explicit caller policy. Use platform moderation or an owner-controlled session role for privileged actions.

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using VRC.SDKBase;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.NoVariableSync)]
public class MasterSessionCoordinator : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private int lastReconciledPlayerCount = -1;

    public override void OnPlayerJoined(VRCPlayerApi player)
    {
        _ReconcilePlayerSlots();
    }

    public override void OnPlayerLeft(VRCPlayerApi player)
    {
        _ReconcilePlayerSlots();
    }

    private void _ReconcilePlayerSlots()
    {
        if (!Networking.IsMaster) return;

        int playerCount = VRCPlayerApi.GetPlayerCount();
        if (lastReconciledPlayerCount == playerCount) return;

        lastReconciledPlayerCount = playerCount;
        // Rebuild derived, non-security slot presentation from the live count.
        // Repeating this after a handoff produces the same result.
    }
}
```

### Local Player Detection

```csharp
public void _OnInteract()
{
    VRCPlayerApi localPlayer = Networking.LocalPlayer;

    if (localPlayer != null)
    {
        interactingPlayerId = localPlayer.playerId;
        interactingPlayerName = localPlayer.displayName;
        RequestSerialization();
    }
}
```

### Synced Timer

```csharp
[UdonSynced] private double gameStartTime;
[UdonSynced] private bool gameRunning;

public void _StartGame()
{
    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
    {
        Networking.SetOwner(Networking.LocalPlayer, gameObject);
    }

    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;

    gameStartTime = Networking.GetServerTimeInSeconds();
    gameRunning = true;
    RequestSerialization();
}

void Update()
{
    if (!gameRunning) return;

    double elapsed = Networking.GetServerTimeInSeconds() - gameStartTime;
    timerDisplay.text = elapsed.ToString("F1");
}
```

---

## Owner-Centric Architecture Migration

`Networking.IsMaster` checks which player is the **instance master** (the first player to join).
Using it to gate critical logic creates two failure modes:

1. **Master-leave gap**: When the master disconnects, VRChat transfers the master role to
   another player. During the brief transition, `Networking.IsMaster` returns `false` on all
   clients simultaneously — timed events or game-state updates can be silently dropped.

2. **Concurrent master race**: If two clients check `Networking.IsMaster` in the same frame
   during a handoff, both may act, causing duplicate state mutations.

The **owner-centric** pattern reduces both risks: a specific `GameObject` has exactly one
owner at all times, so `Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)` typically returns the same result
across all clients. Note that during ownership transfers (e.g., the current owner leaves),
there is a brief transient window where clients may briefly disagree on who the owner is
until VRChat propagates the new ownership to other clients. The `OnOwnershipTransferred` callback is the correct
place to handle this case — re-initialize owner-only state and call `RequestSerialization()`
so all clients converge to the new owner's authoritative state.

### Refactoring Pattern: IsMaster → IsOwner

**Before (IsMaster)**

```csharp
public void _StartGame()
{
    if (!Networking.IsMaster) return;  // Fragile: master may leave mid-check

    gameStartTime = Networking.GetServerTimeInSeconds();
    gameRunning = true;
    RequestSerialization();
}
```

**After (owner-centric)**

```csharp
// Assign one dedicated GameObject as the "game manager" object.
// Its owner is the authoritative game controller.

public void _StartGame()
{
    if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;  // Stable: exactly one owner

    gameStartTime = Networking.GetServerTimeInSeconds();
    gameRunning = true;
    RequestSerialization();
}
```

### Handling Owner Leave

When the owner of the manager object leaves, VRChat automatically transfers ownership.
Resume game-manager duties in `OnOwnershipTransferred`:

```csharp
public override void OnOwnershipTransferred(VRCPlayerApi player)
{
    if (player == null || !player.IsValid()) return;

    if (player.isLocal)
    {
        // Inherited ownership — re-broadcast current state so late joiners are covered
        RequestSerialization();

        // Resume any periodic owner duties here
        if (gameRunning)
        {
            SendCustomEventDelayedSeconds(nameof(_OwnerHeartbeat), 1.0f);
        }
    }
}
```

### Migration Decision Table

| Scenario | Use `IsMaster`? | Use `IsOwner`? |
|---|---|---|
| One-off world init (fires once at world launch) | Acceptable | Preferred |
| Ongoing game logic (timers, spawning, scoring) | No — fragile | Yes |
| Responding to player join/leave events | No — may double-fire | Yes |
| Approving ownership transfers (`OnOwnershipRequest`) | No — wrong API | Neither[^owner-req] |
| Checking if a specific player is the master | `player.isMaster` on `VRCPlayerApi` | N/A |

[^owner-req]: The callback fires on both the requester and the current owner; logic must agree on both clients to avoid desync. See [Ownership Arbitration with OnOwnershipRequest](#ownership-arbitration-with-onownershiprequest) above.
