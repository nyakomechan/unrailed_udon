# VRChat SDK Migration Guide (3.7 to 3.10)

Step-by-step guide for upgrading UdonSharp worlds across major SDK versions.

**Historical migration coverage**: SDK 3.7.x through 3.10.4
**Active support / last verified**: SDK 3.10.5

Use SDK 3.10.5 when publishing. The version markers below preserve feature
availability and migration facts; SDK 3.7.1-3.10.4 are not support or validation
targets for this Skill. This is the Skill's boundary, not a claim about VRChat's
own SDK policy.

## Version markers

Version-specific notes in this skill use three marker forms. Match them verbatim when adding new annotations:

- `(requires SDK X.Y.Z+)` — feature gate. The API, attribute, or component exists only from that version onward.
- `(fixed in SDK X.Y.Z)` — a bug that existed in earlier SDKs is resolved starting with this version.
- `(unresolved as of SDK X.Y.Z)` — a bug is still open in this version. Include a tracking link (canny, GitHub issue) when available.

## SDK 3.10.5 migration

1. Update Base and Worlds together and confirm the resolved package versions.
2. For startup quality settings, inspect the existing
   [WorldQualitySettings component](../../unity-vrc-world-sdk-3/references/components.md#worldqualitysettings-sdk-3105)
   before adding another setter. For Udon controls, read
   [VRCQualitySettings](api.md#vrcqualitysettings--writable-settings-sdk-3105).
3. For package scripts using conditional compilation, verify
   [Assembly Version Defines and the matching U# asset](assembly-definitions.md#assembly-version-defines-sdk-3105).
4. Resolve the new [Pipeline Manager validation](../../unity-vrc-world-sdk-3/references/build-validation.md#pipeline-manager-identity-and-built-scene-checks-sdk-3105)
   without losing the intended blueprint ID. A build processor can invalidate the
   exported scene even when the source scene is correct.
5. Recheck lifecycle tests against the [ClientSim Play → Edit and Build & Reload changes](testing.md).

The final Base/Worlds 3.10.5 artifacts do not contain the preview
`VRCBillboard`, `AttachTransformToBone`, or `DetachTransformFromBone` surfaces.
Do not generate code for them from preview announcements.

## SDK 3.10.4 receiver migration

`UdonSharpBehaviour` directly implements `IUdonEventReceiver` starting with SDK 3.10.4. The active Skill examples therefore pass `this` directly and keep the receiver argument.
The cast below is historical migration syntax for SDK 3.10.3 and earlier; do not copy it into an active 3.10.5 example.

```csharp
using VRC.SDK3.StringLoading;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

VRCStringDownloader.LoadUrl(dataUrl, (IUdonEventReceiver)this);
```

When a project moves to the active SDK target, remove the cast and remove the interface using when that block no longer refers to `IUdonEventReceiver` or another type from that namespace.

## SDK 3.7.x to 3.8.x

### New Features

#### GetComponent<T> for UdonSharpBehaviour Types (SDK 3.8.0+)

Before SDK 3.8, using the generic `GetComponent<T>()` form on types derived from `UdonSharpBehaviour` was unreliable. SDK 3.8 added proper support for the generic form on direct subclasses and through inheritance hierarchies.

```csharp
// SDK 3.7: Required cast syntax for reliability
MyScript s = (MyScript)(object)GetComponent(typeof(MyScript));

// SDK 3.8+: Generic form works correctly
MyScript s = GetComponent<MyScript>();

// SDK 3.8+: Also works through inheritance
public class BaseGimmick : UdonSharpBehaviour { }
public class DerivedGimmick : BaseGimmick { }

BaseGimmick baseGimmick = GetComponent<BaseGimmick>(); // finds DerivedGimmick too
DerivedGimmick derived = GetComponent<DerivedGimmick>();
BaseGimmick[] all = GetComponents<BaseGimmick>();   // plural form also works
```

**Note**: Getting `UdonBehaviour` itself (the raw type, not your subclass) still requires the non-generic cast form: `(UdonBehaviour)GetComponent(typeof(UdonBehaviour))`.

#### [NetworkCallable] — Parameterized Network Events (SDK 3.8.1+)

Before SDK 3.8.1, network events had no parameter support. Callers had to pre-load synced variables and call `RequestSerialization()` before sending an event, creating race conditions.

SDKs before 3.8.1 do not define the `NetworkCallable` attribute or parameterized network-event API, so code that uses them normally fails to compile.

`[NetworkCallable]` adds up to 8 typed parameters per network call, eliminating the pre-serialization pattern. The attribute lives in `VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling`.

```csharp
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using VRC.SDK3.UdonNetworkCalling;
using VRC.SDKBase;
using VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces;

[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class DamageSystem : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] private int health = 100;

    // Before (SDK 3.7): set synced var, RequestSerialization, then fire event
    // After (SDK 3.8.1): pass parameters directly

    [NetworkCallable(1)]
    public void _TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        if (!NetworkCalling.InNetworkCall) return;

        VRCPlayerApi caller = NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer;
        if (caller == null || !caller.IsValid()) return;

        // Concrete owner-only caller policy for this migration sample.
        VRCPlayerApi owner = Networking.GetOwner(gameObject);
        if (owner == null || !owner.IsValid()) return;
        if (caller.playerId != owner.playerId) return;

        // Receiver ownership controls synced mutation, not caller authorization.
        if (!Networking.IsOwner(gameObject)) return;
        if (damage <= 0 || damage > 25) return;

        health = Mathf.Max(0, health - damage);
        RequestSerialization();
    }

    public void _SendDamage(int damage)
    {
        SendCustomNetworkEvent(
            NetworkEventTarget.Owner,
            nameof(_TakeDamage),
            damage
        );
    }
}
```

Network parameters carry the action data, not trusted sender identity. This migration executes both a concrete `1..25` damage bound and an owner-only caller policy derived from `NetworkCalling.CallingPlayer`; neither rule is left as a comment-only placeholder. The leading underscore keeps `_SendDamage` out of the legacy network-callable surface; `[NetworkCallable]` intentionally exposes `_TakeDamage` despite its underscore.

Constraints on `[NetworkCallable]` methods:
- Method must be `public`
- A `[NetworkCallable]` method must return `void`.
- Cannot be `static`, `virtual`, or `override`
- No overloads of a `[NetworkCallable]` method, including same-name methods without the attribute; ordinary direct-call overloads remain supported
- Maximum 8 parameters
- Parameter types must be syncable types (same set as `[UdonSynced]`)
- Default rate limit: 5 calls/sec/event; configurable up to 100/sec via `[NetworkCallable(n)]`

`[NetworkCallable(N)]` paces remote sends for one event on one behaviour and queues excess sends on the sender. It is not an aggregate receiver or resource bound across callers. Local/self calls bypass the pacing, so migrated receivers still need their own idempotence, cooldown, capacity, deduplication, and input checks where aggregate work matters.

#### New NetworkEventTarget Values (SDK 3.8.1+)

Two new targets were added to `NetworkEventTarget`:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NetworkEventTarget.Others` | All players except the sender |
| `NetworkEventTarget.Self` | Local player only (equivalent to direct local call) |

`Others` is particularly useful for effects and sounds: the sender plays the effect locally, then broadcasts to `Others` so it is not played twice.

#### PhysBone Dependency Sorting (SDK 3.8.0+)

PhysBone components in parent-child relationships are now automatically sorted so parent chains evaluate before their children. Worlds that worked around evaluation-order instability with manual ordering may be able to remove those workarounds after upgrading.

#### Drone API: VRCDroneInteractable (SDK 3.8.0+)

SDK 3.8.0 introduced `VRCDroneInteractable` for creating drone-type vehicles. This is a new component category and does not replace or change existing components.

### Breaking Changes

None that affect standard UdonSharp worlds. The `GetComponent<T>` behavior change is purely additive.

### Migration Checklist: 3.7.x to 3.8.x

- [ ] Replace synced-variable-before-event patterns with `[NetworkCallable]` where appropriate
- [ ] Replace `NetworkEventTarget.All` + local guard logic with `NetworkEventTarget.Others` where you were filtering out the sender
- [ ] Replace verbose `(MyScript)(object)GetComponent(typeof(MyScript))` casts with `GetComponent<MyScript>()` in existing scripts
- [ ] Review PhysBone chain ordering; remove manual workarounds that are no longer needed

---

## SDK 3.8.x to 3.9.x

### New Features

#### Camera Dolly Udon API (SDK 3.9.0+)

SDK 3.9.0 added the Camera Dolly system. Animations are authored in the scene (VRC Camera Dolly Animation / Path / Point components) and applied to the local player's camera from UdonSharp.

Key usage pattern: author the dolly animation in the scene, assign a `VRCCameraDollyAnimation` reference in your UdonBehaviour, then call `Import()` to apply it — the only documented scripting entry point (see api.md).

#### Auto Hold Mode Simplification for Pickups (SDK 3.9.0+)

The `Auto Hold` field on `VRC_Pickup` was simplified. The old three-value enum (`Yes / No / AutoDetect`) was replaced with a simple checkbox (`Yes / No`). The `AutoDetect` option (which attempted to infer hold behavior from object size) is no longer available.

```csharp
// SDK 3.8 Inspector: Auto Hold = AutoDetect | Yes | No
// SDK 3.9 Inspector: Auto Hold = checked (Yes) | unchecked (No)

// AutoDetect is gone. Review each pickup and set the checkbox explicitly.
```

Worlds upgrading from 3.8 should audit all `VRC_Pickup` components and confirm the auto hold setting is intentional, since `AutoDetect` no longer exists as a fallback.

#### VRCCameraSettings API (SDK 3.8.1+; CullingMask and GetCurrentCamera added in 3.9.0)

Read-only access to the player's active camera properties. Introduced in SDK 3.8.1; SDK 3.9.0 added `CullingMask` and `VRCCameraSettings.GetCurrentCamera`. Namespace: `VRC.SDK3.Rendering`.

```csharp
using VRC.SDK3.Rendering;

// Two static instances
VRCCameraSettings screen = VRCCameraSettings.ScreenCamera; // main view
VRCCameraSettings photo  = VRCCameraSettings.PhotoCamera;  // in-game photo cam

// Properties (all read-only)
int   width   = screen.PixelWidth;
int   height  = screen.PixelHeight;
float fov     = screen.FieldOfView;
bool  active  = screen.Active;

// Event: fires when any camera property changes
public override void OnVRCCameraSettingsChanged(VRCCameraSettings camera)
{
    if (camera != VRCCameraSettings.ScreenCamera) return; // filter photo cam
    Debug.Log($"Resolution: {camera.PixelWidth}x{camera.PixelHeight}");
}
```

Camera properties cannot be set from Udon; the API is read-only.

#### Network ID Utility Improvements (SDK 3.9.0+)

SDK 3.9.0 included improvements to the Network ID Utility tool in the VRChat SDK panel. The tool assigns and manages network IDs used by `VRC_ObjectSync` and related components. Previously the tool had reliability issues with complex scenes; the 3.9.0 improvements reduced the likelihood of duplicate or missing IDs after scene edits.

**Action required**: After upgrading to SDK 3.9.x, open **VRChat SDK > Utilities > Network ID Utility** and run a scan to confirm IDs are clean.

### Breaking Changes

- **Auto Hold `AutoDetect` removed**: Any `VRC_Pickup` that previously used `AutoDetect` now defaults to `No`. Pickups that relied on auto-detection for hold behavior will need the checkbox set explicitly.

### Migration Checklist: 3.8.x to 3.9.x

- [ ] Open every scene and run **Network ID Utility** to verify no duplicate or missing network IDs
- [ ] Audit all `VRC_Pickup` components: `AutoDetect` is gone; verify each pickup's hold mode is set to the intended `Yes` or `No`
- [ ] Add `OnVRCCameraSettingsChanged` handling where scripts need to react to resolution or FOV changes (optional new capability)
- [ ] Review Camera Dolly sequences if upgrading from a custom dolly implementation

## SDK 3.9.x to 3.10.x

### New Features

#### VRChat Dynamics for Worlds (SDK 3.10.0+)

The largest addition of the 3.10 series: **PhysBones**, **Contacts**, and **VRC Constraints** are now available in worlds, not just on avatars.

**PhysBones** — physics-based bone chains for ropes, flags, chains, and interactive objects.

```csharp
public class GrabbableRope : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public override void OnPhysBoneGrabbed(PhysBoneGrabbedInfo info)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Grabbed by {info.player?.displayName}");
    }

    public override void OnPhysBoneReleased(PhysBoneReleasedInfo info)
    {
        Debug.Log("Released");
    }
}

// PhysBone API
VRCPhysBone pb = GetComponent<VRCPhysBone>();
bool grabbed = pb.IsGrabbed;
pb.ReleaseGrabs(); // force-release grabs on the local client
pb.ReleasePoses(); // release frozen poses on the local client
```

**Contacts** — collision detection between `VRC Contact Sender` and `VRC Contact Receiver` components.

```csharp
public class ContactButton : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public override void OnContactEnter(ContactEnterInfo info)
    {
        if (!info.contactSender.isValid) return;

        ContactSenderProxy sender = info.contactSender;
        if (sender.usage == DynamicsUsage.Avatar && sender.player != null && sender.player.IsValid())
            Debug.Log($"Pressed by {sender.player.displayName}");
        else if (sender.usage == DynamicsUsage.World)
            Debug.Log("Pressed by world object");

        Debug.Log($"Point: {info.contactPoint}, velocity: {info.enterVelocity}");
    }

    public override void OnContactExit(ContactExitInfo info) { }
}
```

**VRC Constraints** — VRChat's alternative to Unity's built-in constraint components. Worlds may use either system on Android, but VRC Constraints are preferred for new work and expose the documented VRChat/Udon APIs.

```csharp
using VRC.SDK3.Dynamics.Constraint.Components;

public class ConstraintController : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public VRCPositionConstraint posConstraint;

    public void _EnableFollow() => posConstraint.IsActive = true;
    public void _DisableFollow() => posConstraint.IsActive = false;

    public void SetWeight(float w) => posConstraint.SetSourceWeight(0, w);
}
```

VRC Constraint types: `VRCPositionConstraint`, `VRCRotationConstraint`, `VRCScaleConstraint`, `VRCParentConstraint`, `VRCAimConstraint`, `VRCLookAtConstraint`. All share a common Udon API (`IsActive`, `GlobalWeight`, `GetSource` / `SetSource`, etc.). See [dynamics.md](dynamics.md) for the full reference.

#### Persistence Storage Information API (SDK 3.10.0+)

New static methods on `VRC.SDKBase.Networking` to query how much PlayerData persistence storage a player is consuming (PlayerObject data has a separate 100 KB per-player quota).

```csharp
int used  = Networking.GetPlayerDataStorageUsage(player); // bytes
int limit = Networking.GetPlayerDataStorageLimit();        // bytes (typically 102400)
Networking.RequestStorageUsageUpdate();                    // request recalculation; result arrives via OnPersistenceUsageUpdated
```

The `OnPersistenceUsageUpdated` event fires when updated usage data arrives:

```csharp
// Always fires on the local player's UdonBehaviours.
public override void OnPersistenceUsageUpdated()
{
    int used  = Networking.GetPlayerDataStorageUsage(Networking.LocalPlayer);
    int limit = Networking.GetPlayerDataStorageLimit();
    Debug.Log($"Storage: {used}/{limit} bytes");
}
```

See [persistence.md](persistence.md) for a full monitoring example.

#### EventTiming Extensions (SDK 3.10.2+)

`SendCustomEventDelayedSeconds` and `SendCustomEventDelayedFrames` gained two new `EventTiming` values:

| EventTiming | When | Use case |
|-------------|------|----------|
| `EventTiming.Update` | Update loop | General logic (was the only option) |
| `EventTiming.LateUpdate` | After all Update calls | Post-animation logic |
| `EventTiming.FixedUpdate` | Physics tick | Physics-synchronized callbacks |
| `EventTiming.PostLateUpdate` | After LateUpdate | Camera follow, post-IK corrections |

```csharp
// Schedule a physics-safe callback
SendCustomEventDelayedSeconds(nameof(_PhysicsStep), 1.0f, EventTiming.FixedUpdate);

// Schedule a camera-follow update after IK
SendCustomEventDelayedFrames(nameof(_UpdateCamera), 1, EventTiming.PostLateUpdate);
```

`FixedUpdate` and `PostLateUpdate` are new in SDK 3.10.2; `Update` and `LateUpdate` existed since SDK 3.7.1.

#### PhysBone Udon Callbacks (SDK 3.10.0+)

World PhysBones expose grab, release, pose, and unpose callbacks on any UdonBehaviour attached to the same GameObject as the `VRC Phys Bone` component:

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `OnPhysBoneGrabbed(PhysBoneGrabbedInfo physBoneInfo)` | PhysBone is grabbed |
| `OnPhysBoneReleased(PhysBoneReleasedInfo physBoneInfo)` | PhysBone is released from a grab |
| `OnPhysBonePosed(PhysBonePosedInfo physBoneInfo)` | PhysBone is locked to a pose |
| `OnPhysBoneUnPosed(PhysBoneUnPosedInfo physBoneInfo)` | PhysBone pose is released |

SDK 3.10.4 does not expose separate PhysBone-collider enter/stay/exit callbacks on `UdonSharpBehaviour`; use Contacts for collider-like touch events.

### Breaking Changes

#### VRCContactReceiver.UpdateContentTypes() and Tags

For SDK 3.10.4 documentation, `UpdateContentTypes()` takes `DynamicsUsageFlags` for allowed content categories, while `UpdateCollisionTags(string[])` changes the matching tag set.

```csharp
receiver.UpdateContentTypes(DynamicsUsageFlags.Avatar | DynamicsUsageFlags.World);
receiver.UpdateCollisionTags(new string[] { "Hand", "Finger" });
```

#### Contact Shape and Payload Updates (SDK 3.10.4)

Contacts now support Box shapes in addition to Sphere and Capsule. Box contacts use `Vector3 size`, with each axis limited to 6 m after scaling. Box receivers can use `Use Face Proximity` so proximity is measured toward the positive-Z face instead of the receiver center.

Runtime shape/configuration edits on `VRCContactSender` or `VRCContactReceiver` must be batched and followed by `ApplyConfigurationChanges()`. Use `CalculateProximity(sender)` when Udon needs an immediate `0.0-1.0` proximity value between a receiver and sender.

Contact event examples should use the proxy payload fields: `contactSender`, `contactReceiver`, `contactPoint`, `enterVelocity`, and `matchingTags`, with proxy `isValid`, `player`, and `usage` checks.

#### Unity Constraints — World Performance

Unity's built-in constraint components (`PositionConstraint`, `ParentConstraint`, etc.)
are permitted in worlds on Android. They can cause significant performance problems
when overused, so prefer VRC Constraints for new work and profile existing constraint
chains on each target device before deciding whether to migrate them.

| Unity Constraint | VRC Replacement |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `PositionConstraint` | `VRCPositionConstraint` |
| `RotationConstraint` | `VRCRotationConstraint` |
| `ScaleConstraint` | `VRCScaleConstraint` |
| `ParentConstraint` | `VRCParentConstraint` |
| `AimConstraint` | `VRCAimConstraint` |
| `LookAtConstraint` | `VRCLookAtConstraint` |

Namespace for all VRC Constraints: `VRC.SDK3.Dynamics.Constraint.Components`.

### Migration Checklist: 3.9.x to 3.10.x

- [ ] Inventory Unity Constraint components; replace them with VRC equivalents when Udon access, consistent authoring, or target-device profiling justifies the migration
- [ ] Add `using VRC.SDK3.Dynamics.Constraint.Components;` to any script that references VRC Constraints
- [ ] Verify contact receivers use `UpdateContentTypes(DynamicsUsageFlags)` for content categories and `UpdateCollisionTags(string[])` for matching tags
- [ ] Implement `OnPersistenceUsageUpdated` if your world writes PlayerData and you want to warn players of storage limits
- [ ] Audit `SendCustomEventDelayed*` calls: use `EventTiming.FixedUpdate` for physics-coupled callbacks, `EventTiming.PostLateUpdate` for camera/IK callbacks, instead of frame-delay workarounds
- [ ] For worlds using PhysBones in world space: avoid placing them inside `Instantiate()`-created objects (PhysBones in instantiated objects may not be network-synced; use scene-placed objects or VRChat Object Pool instead)
- [ ] Test the Contact-based interactions with multiple players; `Allow Self` / `Allow Others` settings on `VRC Contact Receiver` do not apply to world-object senders

#### SDK 3.10.3 changes

Small surface, but each item has non-obvious consequences documented elsewhere — this entry just routes you to them.

- **`VRCPlayerApi.isVRCPlus`** (bool) added. Evaluated per-client; read after `OnPlayerRestored`, not inside `OnPlayerJoined`. Never `[UdonSynced]` the result. Full timing and anti-sync rationale: `api.md` (VRCPlayerApi Properties > isVRCPlus subsection). Worked example: `patterns-core.md` (VRC+ Detection — Reading `isVRCPlus`).
- **VRCRaycast**: avatar-side component (added 3.10.3). Udon runtime access is not indicated by the release notes. World builders should design collider/layer setup with avatar-driven raycasts in mind — see `unity-vrc-world-sdk-3/references/components.md`.
- **Mirror rendering internals**: VRChat's mirror pipeline moved from `OnWillRenderObject` to `Camera.onPreCull` for 2026.1.3 client parity. Udon scripts do not interact with either hook, so no script-side migration is required.
- **Toon Standard shader** (avatar-only): not covered by this skill.
