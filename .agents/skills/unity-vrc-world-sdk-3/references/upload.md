## Build & Test

### Local Testing Procedure

```text
1. VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel
2. Builder tab
3. "Build & Test New Build" section
4. Number of Clients: Number of test clients desired
5. Force Non-VR: Force Desktop mode (optional)
6. "Build & Test" button
```

### Test Items

```text
Single Player Test:
□ Spawn position is correct
□ Respawn Height causes correct respawn
□ Wall/floor collision is correct
□ Pickup can be grabbed/released
□ Station can be entered/exited
□ Mirror works (when enabled)
□ Audio plays correctly
□ Video player works

Multi-Player Test (multiple clients):
□ Spawn positions are distributed
□ Pickup sync is correct
□ Station sync is correct
□ UdonSynced variables sync
□ State syncs for Late Joiners
□ Ownership transfer works correctly
```

### Number of Clients Settings

```text
Recommended by test purpose:

Basic functionality: 1 client
Sync testing: 2 clients
Multi-player testing: 3-4 clients

Notes:
- Each client is an independent VRChat instance
- Consumes PC resources
- First build takes extra time
```

## Validation

### Validation Check Procedure

```text
1. VRChat SDK > Show Control Panel
2. Builder tab
3. Check Validations section
4. Resolve errors (red)
5. Review warnings (yellow)
6. Review informational alerts (white) when they have actionable fixes
```

For copied validation text, red/yellow/white warning questions, or **Auto Fix**
side-effect checks, use the SDK-backed catalog:
[build-validation.md](build-validation.md).

### Build Panel Alert Handling

| Build Panel color | SDK source level | Build consequence | Required response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | `OnGUIError` | Blocks Build & Test / Build & Upload | Resolve before building |
| Yellow | `OnGUIWarning` | Does not block solely by color, but can indicate runtime or compatibility issues | Explain impact and use the safest targeted fix |
| White / info | `OnGUIInformation` | Does not block; often quality/readability guidance | Explain and offer guarded fixes when actionable |

### Common Validation Alerts

| Alert | Cause | Safe direction |
|---|---|---|
| Missing or multiple `VRC_SceneDescriptor` | No descriptor, or more than one descriptor in the scene | Keep exactly one valid descriptor and configure Spawns |
| Layer/collision setup required | VRChat project layers or collision matrix are not configured | Use the SDK setup buttons, then review custom layers and layer masks |
| Unsupported component warnings | Non-whitelisted scripts or components in the scene | Remove them, tag dev-only objects `EditorOnly`, or mark setup-helper components with `IEditorOnly` (see [components.md](components.md#editor-only-objects-and-components)) |
| `AudioSource` without `VRC_SpatialAudioSource` | World audio source is missing the VRChat spatial audio companion | Add the companion deliberately; preserve existing loudness, 2D/3D intent, and distance curves |
| Unity built-in UI shader on uGUI graphics | `Image`, `RawImage`, `Text`, or another uGUI `Graphic` uses `UI/Default` | For affected default-material graphics, assign `Packages/com.vrchat.worlds/Editor/VRCSDK/SDK3/VRCSuperSampledUIMaterial.mat` |
| Spawn below respawn height or too far from origin | Spawn Transform is invalid for the descriptor settings | Move the spawn or adjust Respawn Height so join/respawn works correctly |
| Oversized textures or bundles | Imported assets exceed SDK size checks | Reduce/import assets intentionally; do not delete assets blindly |

### Auto Fix policy

An **Auto Fix** button means the SDK has a fix callback, not that the mutation
is always safe for the world. Before pressing it, check
[build-validation.md](build-validation.md) for the exact fields/assets it
changes and whether it may overwrite authored intent.

Common high-risk examples:

- `AudioSource` fixes can add `VRC_SpatialAudioSource` with SDK defaults; for
  warning-only additions, prefer Gain `0 dB` and preserve existing range/rolloff.
- Super-sampled UI fixes can replace a default material or change a project
  material shader in place; do not replace intentional custom UI materials.
- Layer/collision setup changes project-wide layer configuration.
- Texture fixes reserialize importers and trigger reimport.

## Capacity Settings

### Types of Capacity

| Setting | Purpose | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Recommended Capacity** | Recommended count | UI display, search filter |
| **Maximum Capacity** | Maximum count | Hard limit |

### Configuration Guidelines

```text
Recommended Capacity:
- Number of players for comfortable play
- Number where performance is maintained
- Displayed in UI

Maximum Capacity:
- Technically supportable maximum
- No more can join beyond this
- Usually 2-4x the Recommended

Examples:
- Small world: 8-16 players
- Medium world: 20-32 players
- Large world: 40-80 players
```

### Capacity Best Practices

```text
✅ Recommended:

1. Determine through performance testing
   - Actually test with multiple people
   - Check FPS

2. Consider network load
   - Many synced objects → lower count
   - Static world → higher count

3. Consider the world's purpose
   - Event use → higher count
   - Small group use → lower count

❌ Avoid:

- Setting to maximum without justification
- Deciding without testing
- Ignoring performance
```

   - "My Worlds" section

2. Verify in-game
   - World search
   - Confirm correct display

3. Check settings
   - Publication status
   - Thumbnail
   - Description
```

### Notes After Updating

```text

- Existing instances remain on the old version
- Only new instances use the new version
- Cache clearing may be needed

Propagation time:
- Usually reflects within minutes
- Search indexing may take hours
```

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Build failed" | Build error | Check Console for errors |
| "Upload failed" | Network error | Retry |
| "File too large" | Size exceeded | Reduce assets |
| "Not logged in" | Not logged in | Log in via SDK Panel |
| "Validation failed" | Validation error | Fix errors |

### Common Problems

#### World not found

```text
Cause:
1. Still set to Private
2. Search index not yet updated
3. World name is too generic

Solution:
1. Change to Public
2. Wait a few hours
3. Change to a unique name
4. Access via direct URL
```

#### Upload takes too long

```text
Cause:
1. Build size is large
2. Slow network
3. Server congestion

Solution:
1. Optimize assets
2. Use a stable connection
3. Retry after some time
```

#### Changes not reflected

```text
Cause:
1. Joined an old instance
2. Cache issue
3. Blueprint ID issue

Solution:
1. Create a new instance
2. Clear VRChat cache
3. Verify Blueprint ID
```

### Debug Checklist

```text
□ No errors in Console
□ All Validations pass
□ Blueprint ID is correct
□ Logged in
□ Stable network connection
□ Sufficient disk space
```
