/// <summary>
/// Template for controlling a VRC_Station component from UdonSharp.
///
/// Requirements:
///   - This GameObject MUST have a Collider (required for Interact to fire).
///   - Add a VRC_Station component to the same or a child GameObject.
///
/// Station behaviour notes:
///   - OnStationEntered and OnStationExited fire on ALL clients for any player
///     who enters or exits the station.
///   - Disable Station Exit prevents the default exit gesture; you must call
///     station.ExitStation(player) manually from Udon to release the player.
///   - ImmobilizeForVehicle: Use this mobility mode when the station is on a
///     moving platform (e.g. vehicle). The player view follows the station transform.
///   - Post-processing is unavailable on Android. Prefer baked or lightweight
///     visual effects, and retain realtime lighting only after device profiling.
///
/// Sync mode note:
///   BehaviourSyncMode.None is intentional — this script has no UdonSynced
///   variables. All state tracking (_isOccupied) is local-only; see the field
///   comment below for late-joiner implications.
///
/// Usage:
///   1. Add this script, a Collider, and VRC_Station to the same GameObject.
///   2. Assign the stationComponent field in the Inspector.
///   3. Optionally set PlayerMobility in the Inspector to control movement.
///   4. Extend OnStationEntered / OnStationExited with your world logic.
